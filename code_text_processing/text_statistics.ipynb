       "'no, because you don\\'t change the denominater so this why this answer is wrong.I do not know this answer.Frist you need to double the denometor then do the same to the numrotorFirst, multiply the denominater by two then do the same to the numeraterfirst muply 8 by 2 then do the same to the numratorfirst mutly the denomtor by 2 then do the same for the numoratorFirst muptly the denomator by 2 and do rhe same to the numratorHe needs to find the least common denoiminator so they will both be equal. He also needs to find they multiples and factors.Next time, Olivia tries to find the least common denominator, she needs to look at her numbers more carefully.  She had the 1 and the 7 mixed up.Next time, Kaitie needs to compare 12 and 8 with the factors and multiples of 8 and 12 and find there simallarities.Next time Ryan needs to try more than just one combination.Next time, Matt needs to go over his facts again because all of them were incorrect.Next time, Brad needs to look at the fractions up top and then he needs to then compare.Since 15 and 9 are not divisible, the correct answer has to be because 3 is both divisible with 15 and 9.Sally had the largest number that goes into both denominators.  Sally needs to find fact families.Next time, Lester needs to know that the smaller the fraction the greater it is.Jimmy needs to know that the same thing Lester needed to learn. That the larger the fraction the smaller the amount.Kima had that 2/4 is equal to 1/2 and it is but 4/8 is more like 7/8 than 2/4.Leslie should study her facts and know them so she can more likely to get the common denominator right.I do not know?I don\\'t knowI think she is right because I double checed her answers.In 15/24 there is more space to fill up but in 15/21 there is less to fill up.use comen denomenatersnanwright your work doun.show your work.chek your work.show your work.go over your work.use a couculater.go over your work.use a couculater to help you.check your work.check over your work.your only mistake was the bigger and the larger.check over your work.use a couculater.it should have been > and not <.I think her answer is right.would you want to have 32/65 of somthing or 32/45?I think that the picture is incorrect.I think this because you never add the denomantor.The correct anwwser would be 6/40.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because 32/45 is almost whole. 32/65 is about half.Robert needed to do the same thing to the denominator as to the numerator. we did 6*2 and 9*2 to get our answer.Alison needs to do the same thing to the denominator as to the numerator.My parter and I did 5*2 and 7*2 to get our answer.Alexander should of  done 6*5=30 and 10*5=30.Olivia should of done 21*1=21 and 3*7=21.Kaitie should of done 21*2-24 and 8*3=24.Rayn should of done 5*2=10 and 10*2=10.Matt should of did 6*2=12=3*4.Lester shouid of done 5*8=40 and 9*8=72. Then 5*9=45 and 8*9=72.Jimmy should of did 3*4=12 and 5*4=20.  Then he should of did 1*5-5 and 4*5=20.Kima should of did 7*1=7 and 8*1=8.  then she should of did 1*4=4 and 2*4=8.I think that Kia is incorrect. I know this because you can not add or subtrack  denomonators. The correct answer is 7/9-3/4=4/36.15/21 is larger than 15/24 because  15/21 is about equal to 5/5 which is 1 hole.  15/24 is equal to 5/6 which is 1/6 away from 1 hole.no because you can not subtrack 9-4 in a fractoinif you cut it in peaices you would have bigger slices in 15if you cut it in peaices you would have bigger slices in 15if you cut it in peaices you would have bigger slices in 15 over 21.you need to cross multiple to get the answer or just times 5 =30 and so does 10 times 3mulitply by 8 in both and get your answer5 times what equles 20 then mulitaply 3 time = 12 so 12 over 20 is the answer.just multply them together and it is the answerthe 6 is right but the bottom is not rightif you had a candy bar you would want bigger pices right so i would want 32 45She is wrong because she just subtracted 7-3 and 9-4She is wrong because she just subtracted 7-3 and     9-4. First, your supossed to find a common denominator and convert the fractions then you have to subtract. So what she did wrong was she didn\\'t convert the fractions she just subtracted the top two numbers and the bottom two numbers.15is closer to 21 than 15 is to 24.You need to do 6 times 2, as the  numerator. Then, 9 times 2 as the denominatorAdd 5+5=10 as the denominator. 7+7=14 as the denominator.2 times 2= 4= numerator                                                        8 times 2=16= denominatorHe needs to find a number that both denominators go into but it has to be the smallest number they can both go into. If there isn\\'t a number then multiply both the denominators ans that is the LCD.Olivia accidently switched them so instead of 3 times 7 she did 3 times 21.Then she did 3 times 1. The 1 was supossed to be multiplyed by 21 cuse 3 goes into 21.She will have to divide until its the smallest number that the denonminators go intoKeep dividing for the lest common denominatorJust think if the basic facts like 6 times 2 and 3 times 4.He just switched  the numbers ands only multiplyed 16 times 1He switched the numbersShe switched the numbersFirst, make the LCD, or the number that can go in both denominators, but is the lowest numer the can go into.Have to multiply top and bottom by the same nmber to get the right answer.Since 1/2 can go into 8 as the denominator its easier  just to convert the fraction so it would end up being 1/2= 4/8, and obviously  4/8 is smalller than 7/8.1/4=3/12                                                                                          2/3=8/12                                                                                        3/12<8/12JUst switch the sign.You have to find the LCD  you had one right all you had to do is convert 3/9..Just switch the sign.She is wrong because, first she didn\\'t find a common denominator, and second, she didn\\'t convert the fractions so she could\\'ve gotten  that right answer. So, basically she would\\'ve gotten the right answer if she fund a common denominator.The denominator is bigger so the fraction is smaller.Whatever you do to the numerator you must do to the denominator or your ansewr will be incorrect. Do not add or subtract finding equivalent fractions. When making equivalent fractions you only use  multiplacation or division.When finding least common denomators, make sure your products are the same.When finding least common denomantors, make sure your products are the same.She should make sure both of her denomitors are the same product. She should find all the common multiples of each number.Make sure you always find t common denominator least or you will need to simpify alot.First find LCD and that would be 72.  Since they both have the same denominators now, multiply it by either 8 or 9  depends what the numarator is for the origanal fraction. Make sure your symbol is facing the right way so yo are not making a stupid error.Always find LCD first. Be sure to check that your fraction the is being compared converts back into the fraction you started with that didn\\'t have LCD yet.She did not add them correctly. She first needs find the least common dennominator (LCD).She then needs to convert the denominator to the one common multple they both have. She also needs multiply the numirator by the same factor the denominator was multiplied. She should use the same steps for the other fraction, but this time she should find the factors that equal the common multiple. Then she will be able to add her to fractions. She may also need to simpify so she should simplify to give the best answer.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because the larger the denominator the smaller the fraction is. For example 1/16 is smaller than 1/8. To prove it with common denominators 1/8 is 2/16 which is larger than 1/16.she is wrong because she doesn\\'t  have the least common denominator for 2/8 and 4/5.32/65 is less than 32/45 because 32/65 is cut into smaller pieces than 32/45.multiply the nomerator and denominator by the same whole number.multiply the denominator and numerator by the same whole number.multiply the denominator and numerator by the same whole number.on a line plot you have to add more tic marks of how many are there then move the dot how many you moved it forward.do not add but multiply or divide a fraction to get an equivalent fractionDo not add 2 multiply or divide by 2look for the least common denominator in both frations and not just onelook for the least common denominator in both frations and not just onemake sure you put the numbers in the correct placemake sure it is the smallest multiple for the denominatorsmake sure it is the smallest amount of denominatorsdont divide the denominators multiplyyou have to multiply both denominatorsdont mix up the answers for the LCDmultiply all of the denominators and not just oneShe is wrong because she forgot to do the LCD15/21 is larger because for ex a pizza would be cut into 21 bigger pieces.I think she showed the problem correctly. I think that because she set it up right.It is larger because 21 is biggerIt is larger because 21 is bigger.when 6 and 9 go to the same numbermulitply the same number for each part of the fractionyou need to multiply the numbers the same way fractiondo not add the number multiply itYou need to multiply and not addmultiply by the same numbermultiply the same numbermultiply the same numberwhat can 6 and 10 get to closer21 divided by 3 is 7you need to find out what 12 and 8 is close toyou need to see what 5 and 10 are closer to.Matt needs to multiply the closest number to both 6 and 4.Matt needs to multiply the closer number to 6 and 4Brad needs to multiply the 8 times the number to get to 16Effie has to find the least common denominator.Sally needs to find the least common denominrator that can go in 4 and 24Lester multipled the wrong number for the numoratorJimmy multiplied the the top numoraters on each fraction incorectlyKima did not make the denominators are the same.she is incorrect because she multiplied the numbers wrongly65 is broken into smalleer peicesI know that  if you add the numerator by the denominator you get the answer of 6I know that  if you add the numerator by the denominator you get the answer of 6-12I know that the denominator is smaller the first answer the numerator is the same.jordon needs to have 2/7 but he had 5/7chris did 2/9 but the answer is 7/9norman did this he didnt count the 1 tick marksyou had to shade 1/8 to help johnwe had to find roberts mistakeHer mistake is the she had to double the number but she had to take away for the 21we figure out the awnser is 4/16what lester had to do was he had to the answerWE HAD TO FIX JIMMYS MISTAKES BEACAUES 1/4 IS EQUAL TO 5/20we had to fixkima\\'s least common denomernatorshe is correct bescuse if you - the two  you will get 4/5 she is correct15/21 is not correct becuse the denomntor is bigger in the second one so then 15/24 is bigger then 15/21.no,you arn\\'t supposed to subtract the denominatorsBecause 24 is larger than 21 you need to fill in moreBecause 24 is larger than 21 you need to fill in more to 24to check your answeryou need to multiply by twoyou need to learn to multiply by two and check your answermultiply by twomultiply by twoyou need to multiply by twoyou need to multiply and not add!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!multiply by two!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ceck your answersyou need to multiplyyou need to know your multiplication facts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!learn your multiplication!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!multiplymultilplymultiplymultiplymouth eats the bigger onegood jobgood job dont times twodont addmouth eats the big onegood jobdont` addmouth eats biggeryou are not supposed to add the denominators\\\\you are not supposed to add the denominatorsbecause the denominator is larger it takes up less spacewhen the denominators are the same, the fraction with the higher numerator is the larger fractionthe LCD is the smallest number that is a multiple of both denominatorsI think she can because 7-3=4 and 9-4=5.it is larger because 21 would have more shaded in if it were a drawing than 24.What you need to do next time to get the problem correct is not divide six by three but multiply six by two.To get the problem correct you need to multiply the five in the numerator and the six in the denomonator to get thirty. and three trims ten is equal to six by fiveWhat Oliva needs to bo to get the correct answer is get the least common denominator for both fractions.To get the correct answer to this problem is  to find the closest least common denominatorTo get the problem correct Ryan needs to closest least common denominator.To make the answer correct you need to check over the picture of the fractions and see if 5/8 is larger or smaller than 5/9.    Correct Answer: 5/8>5/9To make the answer correct you need to multiply the numerater,3, by 4 and multiply the other numerator,1, by 5 to find the answers of 12/20 and 5/20.I do not think this is correct because you need to convert 4/5 to 6/8 and add them together, not 2/8 and 4/5. The answer she should have gotten isI do not think this is correct because you need to convert 4/5 to 6/8 and add them together, not 2/8 and 4/5. The answer she should have gotten is 8/8.32/65 is smaller because it has smaller parts than 32/45. It has more parts as well.Only use division or multipication or divcision, dont use both.Make sure that it is the smallest number instead of one in the middle.  Also make sure the denomonators are the same.Multiply by the same or different numbers to get one denominator.Multiply the denomonators by the smallest number possibleMulity both numbers by the smallest denominator possible to get the least common denominator.Mulity the two numbers by the same number to get a commojn denominator.Multiply the denominatorts by the smallest number possible to get a least common denominator.Mulitply the same numbers in the denominators for the leats common denominator.Multiply the denominators by the smallest numbers possible to get the least common denominatior.To figure out if the fractions are <,>, or = convert the fractions to have the same denominator and then judge from the numerator.make the fractions the same and find out what the lcd isfind the least comm0on denominatorfind thye lcdfind the lcdMake sure you are multipling by the same number for the numorator.find t6he lcdfind the lcdKia is wrong, beacause she convert the fractions so they have alike denominators before she added them. Since she did this wrong, 6/13 isn\\'t the answer, the correct answer is 42/40 or 1 2/40 or 1 1/20.Even though they have the same numerator, 32/65 is smaller than 32/45. Since the denominator in 32/65 is bigger,each part of it(represented by the numerator)is smaller, so 32/45 is larger.she is wrong. you dont add the denomonatorsi dont knowpay more attention to the problemPay more attention to the problemNext time use more timenext time dont addDont adddo it rightdo it rightdont addthink before you actim smartthink morerethink moreim smartworkworkwork harderwork haredlook at the numeratorlook at the numeratorfind the coorect answerdoit correctdo it betterthink morework hardertry hardershe is wrong21 is smaller than 24She is correct because her pictures show very clearly that she subtracted 7/9 and 3/4 to get 4/5.15/21 is larger than 15/24 because the denominator is smaller. That means that the fraction has bigger pieces, making the WHOLE bigger.He needs to multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2 so he can get an equivalent fraction.She needs to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number to get an equivalent fraction.Vanessa needs to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number, and multipy or divide BOTH.He needs to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number to get an equivalent fraction.To get an equivalent fraction, he needs to change BOTH the denominator and the numerator.She needs to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number to get an equivalent fraction.He needs to convert the fractions to twelths to he can get an equivalent fraction.She is wrong because she needs to convert her fractions because they have different denominators.Because the smaller the denominator, the bigger the piece.I think that she is not correct because Kia needs to make the fractions the same denominator instead of leavivng it the same.Its smaller because 32/45 would equal a bigger fraction and 32/65 would equal a smaller fraction than the other fraction.He needs to multiply 6/9 by 2 for each number to get the right answer.She needs to add by 5 for the 5 and add by 7 for the 7.Vanessa needs to add 2 for the 2 and add 8 to the 8.She needs to add 4 to 4 and add 5 to  5.He needs to add 1 to 1 and add 3 to 3.All he needs to do is add 3 to 3 and add 6 to 6.All she needs to do is add 2 to 2 and add 7 to 7.All he needs to do is add 6 to 6 and 8 to 8.Alexander has to multiply 6 times 5 and that equals to 30 then divid 30 by 3 and u would get ten.She needs to multiply 21 by 1 then that equals 21 then 7 times 3 equals 21.She needs to multiply 12 by 2 to get 24 then multiply 3 by 8.All he needs to do is multiply 5 by 2.All he needs to do is multiply 6 times 2.Multiply by 2.Multipliy by 5 and 3.Multiply by 6.Multiply by 8 and 5 to get the answer.Multiply by 4

arent the same.Its larger than 15/24 because the less the number is the bigger the answer and the bigger the problem is gonna have a less answer answer.that thay are the same32 is smaller because 45 is ecilfithe needed to multipy by 2 to get the answer because 6 times 2 equals 12 and 9 times 2 is 18.you need to multiply 2 tims 5 is 10 and 7 time2 is 14you need to add 5 times 9 and 5 times 8you need to add 3 times 5 and 1 times 4She is wrong 7/9 = 28/36 and 3/4 = 27/36 and 28/36 -27/36 = 1/36 which equals 4/9 or  9/4 which equals 2 1/4It is larger because the smaller the denominator is the larger the fraction isYou need to double both the denominater and the numeratordouble the numorator and denominatorfind some thng they each equal and say what number to multiply it byYou use multiplcation to find out what number both denomnaters go intoSee if you can find what number both denominaters go intoyou have to multiply by the smallest number that both equal the same numberyou

wrongWHen the denominator is bigger than the other fractions and it is the same numarator it is smaller because the bigger the denominator is the more pieces and the smaller the pieces are.she is

in out of 4     4 are filled inout of 5because 21 is less than 24When you make an equivalent fraction, you must change the numerator and denominator the same amount of times.  For example, when you have 6/9, you must multiply 6 and 9 by 2 to get 12/18 instead of dividing 6 by 3 and multiplying 9 by 3.You must find a number with an equation to represent it from both denominators to find a common denominator.  Also, the common denominator must be able to go into each of the numerators.Olivia made the mistake of trying to do different operations while thinking they were the same.  She multiplied 21 x 7 and got 3, which is not correct.  Instead, 21/ 7 is 3.Kaitie forgot to check if there was a common denominator below the product of both denominators.  When you multiply two denominators together, you will always get a common denominator, but sometimes there is one smaller than the product of the two denominators.He must check to make sure there is not a common denominator below the product of the denominators.  Multiplying the denominators together will always result in a common denominator, but in some cases, such as this one, there is a common denominator smaller than the product of the two denominators.the one the with the larger numerator is the largest when the denominator is the same.The number you multiply the denominator by is the same numbr you multiply the top or numerator by.you need to convert to the same denominator.When she multiplies the denominator and numerator she needs to make sure she does it by the same numbers.she needs to make the denominator common before addingWhen the numerators are equal, the fraction with larger number as its denominator is is smallershe is correct because it shows how she got her awnsere and what she didwell i know if hte denominator is smaller than the other denominator 65 is higher than 45 so it would be biggerhe needs to read directions and times it by 2 to get his awnserehe needs to double the numbers to get his correct awnsrelisten to directionsdirectionsbutshe is correct because she showed that is you - you will get four fifthsbecause the denominator is larger to the one on the leftshe is right because the fraction strips are the same size they are just cut up insmaller pices.The first one is bigger because the denominator15 over 21 is bigger becausehe needed to multipy by 2 to get the answer because 6 times 2 equals 12 and 9 times 2 is 18.you need to multiply 2 tims 5 is 10 and 7 time2 is 14you need to add 5 times 9 and 5 times 8you need to add 3 times 5 and 1 times 4I think she got the right answer becausse all  the fraction strips have what she showed . so she is right.It is smaller because if the denominators number is smaller the other is bigger.Kia didn\\'t  make the fractions have the same denominator, Kia should have looked for the least common denominator and then added the two fractions32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because it has a bigger denominator which makes the size of each piece smaller. 32/45 has a smaller denominator making it\\'s 45 pieces bigger if you take one piece out of each, the 32/45 piece will be bigger because it is a smaller number so it can be larger to fit 1/45 of a spaceHe needs to learn his multiplication problems, he can then go through all of the multiples of 6 and 10 and get the answer rightLike Alexander she needs to learn her multiplication problemsLearning multiplicationPractice multiplication and find the smallest denominatorHe needs to learn multiplication8 x 2 = 16He should learn multiplication betterHe should multiply  bothShe should make the 7/8 the same and only change 2/4She should multiply all fractionsHe needs to find out which one is largerShe needs to reduce the fractionShe needs to multiply both the denominator and numeratorHe needs to know which one is greaterI dont think it is right because kia didnt simplify her problems, she just subtracted the problems15/21 is larger than 15/24 because there are the same amount but bigger piecesNo,you are not allowed to change the denominator you have to keep it the same. You would have to make the denominators the exact same number.I know that 32I know that because 65 would be cut up into smaller pieces than 45. So 45 would be shaded more because it is cut into larger pieces.jordan needs to look at the shaded tranglesChris needed to look at the shaded rectangleRobert needed to multiply 6 times 2 and 9 times 2She need to mutiply 5 times 2 and 7 times 2she needed to multiply 2 times 2 and 2 times 8he had to know that 6 times 5 is 30 and also that that is equal to 3 times 10 is the same aswerWhen we put 7 it worked but the rest were wrong so we did 7 times 3 since 3 was already there and got 21 so that 21 was already there and we new that 21 times 1 is 21 so they would be equal.Lester did the larger denominator is the larger fraction.Jimmy did to convert the fraction, the numerator was added.Kima did the Idc is the largest factor for both denomitors.She has the right idea but she doesn\\'t know that you are not supposed to subtract the denominator.15 24ths is divided into smaller pieces so it would fill up less pieces. 15 21ths would heve larger pieces because 21 is smaller than 24.I think that the denominators should be the same. Then, you never subtract the denominators only the numerator.Instead of shading the missing parts shade the parts shaded. Then check over your work.you hav a good argument but rong conclutionYou should read over your work to make sure that everything is correct.Make sure you read over the directions twice.Read over your fractions.Make sure your fraction strips are correct.Make sure that your fractions are correct.blu blu bluKia added every thing including numerator and denominatorThe denominator is larger so the peices are smaller.she is incorrect because she added the numerator and the denominator by 2/8 and 4/532/65 is smaller then 32/45 because 32/45 is closer to the whole.be smarterbe smarter oliviareally catielol sup fam squadi liked the way u set up the problemyes good jobgood job setting the problem up1!good job famyesfammkokkgoodgreatwrongits bigger because it is closer to wholeFirst  I would find the least common denominator whitch would be 36 beacause 9*4First  I would find the least common denominator whitch would be 36 beacause 9x4= 36 so the fraction would be 28/36 - 27/36 = 1/36First  I would find the least common denominator whitch would be 36 beacause 9x4= 36 so the fraction would be 28/36 - 27/36 = 1/36.First  I would find the least common denominator whitch would be 36 beacause 9x4= 36 so the fraction would be 28/36 - 27/36 = 1/36.  The answer would be 1/36 and it can not be reduced.15/21 is bigger than 15/24 because if you reduce them15/21 is bigger than 15/24 because if you reduce them you get  15/21= 5/7 and 15/24= 5/815/21 is bigger than 15/24 because if you reduce them you get  15/21= 5/7 and 15/24= 5/8He should see first if the 2 numbers can be doubled to match his fractionsame with Robert she needs to check and see if

the bottem numbers instead of finding the commen denomonater32/65 is smaller because the numerator is the same, but 32/45 has a smaller denomonator, there for therre is a smaller space to fill.alexander needs to remember that the smallest number that goes into both denominators is the right way to do the problem and correct your multiplycationolivia needs to multiply instead of divide and needs to remember that the largest number that goes into both denominators is the least common denominator.kaitie needs to remember to try and make the number as small as she canremember the smaller  denominator means there is a smaller space to fillwhen your converting fractions, never add something to the numorator. instead, if you want to convert a fraction, find the least common denominator for both fractions and devide the least common denominator by the original fractions denominator and multiply that answer by the original fractions numorator.Kima needs to remember not to make the least common denominator the largest factor for both denominators.Leslie needs to remember to never convert the fraction by adding tha numoratorremember to fixth simblekia did not find the lcd and just whent out and subtracted the denominators and the numeratorsthe two numerators are the same but 15/21 has a smaller denominator so there is less space to fillI dissagree because, she didn\\'t find a common denominator and she subtracted the denominators.If you give them a common denominator you will get 360/504 and 315/504. 360 /504 is greater than 315/504.Our advice to you is to practice yout multiplication facts so you won\\'t get questions like these wrong.Don\\'t multiply the numerator and denominator by different numbers.Our advice is to multiply both the numerator and denominator by the same number.Multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number.Multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number.You need to get the smallest number that goes into each number that will work.You must find the least common denominator by multipling to get the same number for each denominator.You need to find the number 24 so you can find the least common denominator by finding the number combinations that go into each number.You must find the smallest number that will go into both numbers to find the least common denominator.You must find the smallest number that goes into both denominators.You must find the largest  number that goes into both denominators.You must find the smallest number that goes into each denominator.You must find the largest number that goes into both denominators.You must find out that the larger denominator is the larger fraction.To convert the fraction, the numerator must be added to.The LCD is the largest factor of both denominators.To convert the fraction, the numerator was added to.The larger denominator is the larger fraction.The LCD is the largest factor for both denominators.To convert the fraction, the numerator was added to.The larger denomininator is the larger fraction.She is wrong because she added the denominators and she didn\\'t find the least common denominator.I know that 32/65 is less than 1 half and 32/45 is greater than 1/2.I think she is wrong because those added together are more than 1 wholeThe denomator 65 is greater than the denomator 45 so there is more room to fill in 65 but less in 45Frist you need to double the denometor then do the same to the numrotorFirst, multiply the denominater by two then do the same to the numeraterfirst muply 8 by 2 then do the same to the numratorfirst mutly the denomtor by 2 then do the same for the numoratorFirst muptly the denomator by 2 and do rhe same to the numratorInstead of 5 times nine you should have done 5 time 8.You need to multiply the denominator and numerator to compare the fractions.First make somthing equal to 1 half that 8 can be or go into 8  then since 8 can go into 8 keep that the sameFirst make the denomators equal then multply the numtars same amount of times as the denomator to get your answerI dont agree with Kia.In a problem like this you cant subtract the denomator.The denomator is smaller and the numator is the same the numrator takes up more space.it is taking away sections of the shapes.because you have to change your denmnators and what every you do to the bottom you have to do to the tope so you can have a like fractionsTO SEE THAT BOTH EQASTIONS ARE EQUAL TO THE ANWSER.YOU NEED TO HAVE EQLIVENT EQUSTIONS TO GET THE RIGHT ANWSERYOU NEED TO SEE THAT THE PROMLEMS ARE THE SAME ANWSERS

AND THE  ANWSERMaybe you should write it down on paper instead of doing the problem in your head beacause you might get lost and get the wrong answer, or you might get confused.First, write the problem down on paper so you won\\'t get confused,and then solve the problem.Second, double check your work.Last, make sure your stradegy is correct.Look at your two numerator\\'s and decide which number is larger and then that is the one that is larger. Also, you might want to write the problem down on paper from now on so you don\\'t get confused.Kia is wrong, because she subtracted 7 and 3 to get 4, and then subtracted 9 and 4 to get 5, and got 4/5. She should\\'ve tried to find the least common denominator and make the denominator the same and then subtract only the numerators that you found to get the correct answer.Both fractions have the same numerator, since smaller fractions have bigger pieces they are worth more than a bigger fraction. When a fraction has the same numerator but not the same denominator, the smaller denominator is the largest.Incorretbecause there is 65 pieces in the first one but 45 in the second.check your workchek your workckek your workchek your workchek your workchek your workchek your workchek your workchek your workchek your workchek your yourthis is not correct beacause the numbers are not subtracted correctlyBecause 21 as a denominator is LESS then 24When you are finding an equivalent fraction, you need to do the same thing to both the numerator and the denominator. When you would find an equivalent fraction for 6/9, it would not be 2/27, because you divided 6 by two and multiplied 9 by three. If you wanted to simplify the fraction, or find a smaller equivalent fraction, you could divide each of the numbers by a number that goes into the numerator and the denominater. So, you could divide 6 and 9 by three, which would reduce the fraction to 2/3. If you wanted to make the fraction larger, you would have to multiply both numbers by the same number, of your choice.When you find an LCD, you have to find the lowest number that both denominators can go into. You have to make sure that the denominators of both fractions can both go into the same number.If you have a larger number for the denominator of one of the fractions, I suggest multiplying it by only one, as long as the denominator of the other fraction goes into that number.Instead of just multiplying the denominators by each other, try running through your facts, and you will find that the two denominators will probably have a number they both go in. If not, then you multiply them by each other.If you have a larger number, you can multiply it by itself to keep it smaller as long as the smaller denominator goes into it.If you have two even numbers for the denominators, they will probably have an LCD without multiplying them by each other.If you have a larger number as a denominator, multiply it by itself as long s the smaller denominator can go into it equally.If you have two odd numbers, try multiplying them by another odd number to get the same one.The LCD cannot be smaller than any of the denominators.The fraction with the larger numerator out of two fractions with the same denominator is larger.Don\\'t add the numerator to the final equivalent fraction.You have to have the same denominator in two fractions if you are trying to add them together, otherwise you will get the problem wrong.Don\\'t add the numerator to the final equivalent fraction.You can draw pictures of fractions to help you determine which one is larger.WHen adding fractions, you need to find a number that both denominators can go into.Don\\'t add the numerator to the final equivalent fraction.Draw out fractions to help you determine which one is larger.7/9-3/4=4/5 is incorrect. I can tell by the pictures that it is not the right answer.15/21 is larger than 15/24 because its denominator is smaller.First, the denomonatoresRobert needs to do the same thing to the denominator also to the numeratorDo the same thing to the denominator and the numerator.What ever you do to the denominator for the first fraction has to be related to the other denominator fraction.Again you have to do the same thing to the denominator to the first fraction also to the second fraction.you have to find the lest common denonatorand itAlways find the least common denominator and it should be small.Always find the least common denominator!!!!!!COMMON DENOMINATORSFind the least common denomintor.Again find the least common denominatorLook at the problem carefullyFind the least common denominatorKeep the same denominatorLook at the problems\\\\she did not find least common denomenator and she was not supost to subtract the denomanatorbecause the denomonator is larger bebecause 21 in a graph 21 is larger1.yesKia is wrong because, 7/9- 3/4 is not 4/5 it is 1/36It is greater because 21 is smaller than 24 so that means that there is a smaller space being filled up.He needs to get the numrator and the denominator the same by multplying by the same number. Don\\'t forget to simplfliy!She should multply by the same number toget an equvilent fraction.Dont forgrt to symplfyVanessa needs to multply by 2 because it says double what you do to the numerator you MUST do to the denomiatorWhen finding LCD you should figure out the smallest number that goes into both denominatoroliva need to miluty b the least common demnominatorshe can\\'t mulity by the dming the  to fnominateos she hashe muily the product of the demnominatorthe least common demnominator is 12 he thought you divideBrad when you find LCD DONT multply the denmanators togetherLester when you find LCD you find a number that goes into both denomators. And what you do to the bottom you do to the topjimmy didnt fing the lcd rightkima made the eror and the lcd is 8I think that she is wrong...Because, 65 is larger than 45 so 65 is a smaller SPACE!She is correct because all 3 models represent their fraction correctly.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because you are dividing 32 amoung 65 parts so the parts are going to be smaller than in 32/45 because they will be splitting up 32 amoung 45 parts so the parts will be larger.Look at the numerater and denomnator very closly multiply/divide by  the same numberPay attention to all the numbers.paypay attentionpay attentionpay ATTENTIOpay attionpay lots of attentionpay the thing of attentionlook at the larger number aer greatnd that one isi think she is wrongthe denominator is smaller wich means the parts are largeri think Kia answer is wrong because she did not make it a comman donatmater and just added accros.i think Kia answer is wrong because she did not make it a comman donatmater and just added accros.my answer is 34/40 because 2/8 and 4/5 have the same comman donamater of 40 so i then did 5 dived by 40 and got 8 then i did 4 times 8 and got 24 over 40 then on 2/8 i did8 dived by 40 and got 5 so i did 2 times to = 34 4032/65 is smaller than 32/45 because 65 is a higher number so that means they would have to split it with more people but 32/45 you would not have to split it bwteen as many peopleyou need to make sure both of the number = the comman denominators times and what it is out 6x5=30 and 3 x 10 = 30you need to match the denominators to the least comman denominators mutply by doing 21x1 7x3 and the both = 21she was not making the least common denominator shre had the largest common denominatorhe did the largest common denominator not the smallest common denominator.Matt put the common denominator too low.you have to make the fraction thatis supposed to be bigger, make it bigger than the other fraction.The denominators were not the samethe denomations that she did did not match the restthe denominators need to match, and you need to multiply the denominators.he made the larger denominator the larger fraction.the icd is the largest factor for both denominatorsi think the anwser is 0 because if you take 7 /9- 3/4 the 3/4 is the same as 7/9 and so your anwser would be 015/21 is bigger than 15/24 because 15/24 you have to split 15 into more things but with 15/21 \\\\you would only have to split it into 21 not 24she is correct, because she showed a picture of she would get her answer and if she find the lcd or least common denominator, she will have to add and then she\\'ll get her answethe denominator is bigger so it is the smaller numberadd another set of that number or multiply by 2find the least common denominator or lcdfind the least commond denominator or lcdshe needs to find the least common denominatorshe needs to find the least common denominatorfind the least common denominatorfind the least common denominatorthink about the common denominatorhe needs to think about the least common denominatorlook at the denominatorslook at the denominatorslook at the denominatorslook at the denominatorlook at the denominatorshe is correct and alll she has to do now is make the least common denominatorit has a smaller denominatorshe could change her denominators to a larger number that both nine and four can go into.He needs to find the smallest number they have in common.she needs to learn her math.She needs a tutor.She needs to learn her math.he needs to learn his math!!!

:)15/21 is larger than 15/24 because 24 as the denominator has smaller pieces so 21 would cover more space and would be largerNo,because they all have to have the same denominater to add them and they dont.If she did two-eighths plus four-fifths it would not equal six-thertenths because they dont have a common denominater i think it would be two-eighths plus four-fifths equal siI know that thirty-two over fourty-five is close so i thought thirty over sixty five is smaller than thirty two over fourty five because it is close to 1 holeer 36. good and by the way the fraction is 15 over 21 the endI know that if you mulitply the numerrator and denominator by the same number you will get an ecuvilent farcson.For example 5 times 2 = 10 and 10 will be the numerrator and 7 times 2 = 14 and 14 will be the denominator. Thisis how i know that Alison is wrI know that 2 times 2 =4 and 8thies 2 =16 so i put 4 in the numerator box and 16 in the denominator box. i know this becuse if you mulitpy the numerator and the denominator by the same number. this i how i know that Vanessa made a mastac.i know that the bigger the denominater the smaller the fraction or piece so i know that the fractions are correct because of the way i know thati know that when you are making a eculivent fraction you have  to mulitply  the numerator and denominator by the same number to get the right answer . for example i know i was right because i did the right melid to get the answer.No, because i know that if you want to subtract fractions or add fractions you have to have the same denominater so i could do 7 over 9 - 3 over 9 and the answer would be 4 over 9 and she does not have the same denominater so she cant do that THE END !!!!BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE BIGGER THE DENOMINATER THE SMALLER THE FRACTION AND 24 IS LARGER THAN 21 SO THATS WHYif say five sixths and you had to round up to what it equals wich has to be half of the other fraction.you have to look at your problem and see if you are right like 5 times 6 equals 30 or 3 times 10 equals 30 so you have to see that they both equals 30lester needs to look at his numerator and his denominator more or he will never get the answerJimmy has to look at his problem and count by that number until you get it.seinse 2\\\\8 is is one fith then that makes it a wholebecase the denominator is biger than the denominator 45no it would be sixth seventhsbecause it doesn\\'t matter what the amount the number is it just matters what it shows in a picturehe has to multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2she has to multiply the first fractions numerator and  denominator by 2she has to multiply the first fractions numerator and denominator by 2she has to multiply the first fractions numbers by 2he has to multiply the first fractions numbers by 2multiply the first fractions numbers by 2she has to multiply the first fraction by 2he has to multiply the first fraction by 2he has to multiply 6 by 5 and 10 by 3he has to multiply both of the numbers by 1 and 7he has multiply  both numbers by 2 and 3he has to multiply both numbers by 2 and 16 times 2 is 12 and 3 times 4 is 128 times 2 is 16 and 1 times 16 is 163 times 15 is 45 and 5 times 9 is 456 times 4 is 24 and 24 times 1 is 24he has to make them equalhe has to make them equalshe has to make them equalshe has to make them equalhe has to make them equalshe has to make them equalshe has to make them equalhe has to convert themwhat the fractions equalits larger because the number is closer to a whole fractionI do not think think the answer is 6/13 because first you need to get a common denominator which would be 40.Then multipli the numerator by how much you multiplied the denominater for the denominater to be 40. You should get 10/40 =2/8 and 32/40=4/5. Add them together and get 42/40 or 1 2/4032/65 is smaller than 32/45 because 32/65 has more blank space than 32/45 does.First, you need to double the denominator and then the numerator.When you multiply to get the least common denominater you need to make sure you get the same answer for both numbers.When you multiply to get the same denominater you need to make you end up with the same answer.before you get a large multiple try to get the smallest one first.Try your best to get the same denominator ,but the smallest one you can.Just keep trying your best everyone makes mistakes.everyone makes these mistakes never give upYou should have the same answer for each denominater.Recheck your findings.to multiply what you multiply the denominator bymake sure they end up with the same denominator.ydo not add the numeratorCheck your resultstry your best stay positiveI think that Kia is wrong because first you need to get a common denominator which would be 36.Then multiply the numerator by what you multiplied the denominator by.Next you should of got 28/36-27/36 and get 1/36.15/21 is larger than 15/24 because 15/21 has less blank space than 15/24.7/9 is = to

multiplied rongly yabba dabba doo.He did math rongery.He multiplied differently.Yes, i think that is correct.The numerators are larger.I think she is wrong because she did not find the least common denominator before she subtracted.It is larger because it has a smaller denominator.You have to just multiply the numerator and denomenator by 2.Just multiply the numerator and denomenator by 2.Follow

denomanator is the smaller number.she didnt find a common denominator, so she got an inncorect answer.  My answer is 28/36 - 27/36 = 1/36.  I got this answer from multiplying my two denominators together, and whatever you do to your denominator you have to do to the numenator.  Then I did 4x7 and 9x3 and got my answer of 1/36she didnt find a common denominator, so she got an inncorect answer.  My answer is 28/36 - 27/36 = 1/36.  I got this answer from multiplying my two denominators together, and whatever you do to your denominator you have to do to the numenator.  Then I did 4x7 and 9x3 and got my answer of 1/36 .15/21 is larger than 15/24 becuase it has less15/21 is larger than 15/24 becuase it takes up more space.  What I mean is if the shape was a square it would take up more room in that square becuase 21 is broken into smaller pieces.first find the number that they both go into like multiplying the two numbers togther, so that would be 60.  Then divide that number till you get one that they both go into.You could see how many times 3 goes into 21.  Then you get 7, so you do 3x7 and 21x1.Do a fration tree and look at the numbers that are in both of them, and when you see a match you have your least common denominator.First you could see how many times your smaller denominator goes into your larger  denominator.  Then you have your least common denominator.Multiply your smaller denominator untill you get to the larger denominator.  It would look like 4,8,12.Find a number that they both go into and multiply those two numbers by that number.The top numbers denominator is the on you have to multiply your fration at the bottom by.  You also have to multiply the numerator by whatever number you multipled  your denominator with.The least common denominator is always itself, but only if your smaller number can go into the bigger number.  It will never be the smaller number becuase the least common denominatorI think this is wrong becuase kia added the denominators wich would make the prblem wrong.  This would effect the answer to this problem becuase you have to find a common denominator, and add the numerators together.  Then if you find the commmon denominator you have to change the numerator too.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 becuase if you have a square 65 would separate the square into more pieces, so each 1/65 would be smaller than 1/45 becuase the square would be separated into larger parts.I think she is wrong because you need to have alike denominaters to add or subtract otherwise it would be wrong and it wouldn\\'t make sense.The smaller the denominator the bigger the piece and the bigger the denominator the smaller the piece.she thought the non shaded pieces was the numerator but the darker pieces is the numeratorhe thought the non shaded piece was the numeratorhe counted  only the smaller  tickmarks and not the intervalshe needed to shade 1/8 but he forgot to put the numerator number on the circleshe forgot to shade 4/5 and was wrongRobert multiplied the numerators of the two fractions and divided the denominators of the two fractions when you have to do the same techniqe to both the numerators and the denominators.you have to muiltiply the numerator and the denominator by the SAME number.You can\\'t multiply the numerators then divide the denominators.You need to have equivalent fractions on the two sides and both have the same answerHe needs to look at his fraction circle a little more carefullyhe needs to multiply correctlyShe is wrong because she added the numerators of both fractions and the denominators she added too but you have to have alike denominators to add only the numerators and the denominator stays the same.The bigger the denominator the smaller the piece.That is incorrect because when i did the least common denominator i got 28/36 - 27/36=1/36.It is larger because 21 is less than 24 so the smaller denominator means that the numernator has bigger parts.Never do addition and always multiply if you add you might get the problem wrong look for the least common denominatorlook for the least common denominatordo not subtract the numeratorlook for the least common denominator do not add or subtact multiplylook for the least common denominator and do not add or subtract multiplydo not add and just multiply look for the least common denominatorinstead of adding multiply and look for the least common denominatorlook for the least common denominatorlook for the least common denominatorlook for the least common denominatorlook for the least common denominatorlook for the least common denominatorlook for the least common denominatorlook for the least common denominatorlook for the least common denominator do not add or subtractlook for the least common denominator and do not add or subtract the fractionslook for the LCD and do not add or subtractlook for the LCD do not add or subtract the fractionslook for the LCD never add or subtract the fractionsloom for the LCD and never add or subtract the fractionslook for the LCD and never add or subtract the fractionslook for the LCD and never add and subtract the fractionslook for the LCD and do not add or subtract the fractionslook for the LCD and do not add or subtract the fractionsThat is wrong because she added the denominators but you had to look for the LCDit is smaller because the bigger denominator means there are more partsShe is wrong because you do not add the eieght and five denomanators.She is wrong because she added the denomanaters so she couldn\\'t get the right answer.Get a commen denomanator and multiply the tops by the number you multiplyed for the denomanator.Multiply the denomanator by 1 and 7. then multiply the numerator by what you did to the bottemsYou don\\'t multiply the one denomanator with the other denomanator to get the least common denomanator.appleyou have to multiply the numerator by the number you multipyed the denomanator.you can multiply 1/2 by 8 and then you multiply 7/8 by 2 and then you add themyou see wich fraction is biggeryou see wich fraction is biggeryou add fractionsadd fractionsappleNo because you can\\'t subtract fractions if their denomanators are differ.No because you can\\'t subtract fractio if their denomanators are differentNo becNo because you can\\'t subtract fractions if their denomanators are different.the denomanator is smaller.I think that she has the right idea but rong explanaitionInstead of shading the missing parts shade the parts shaded. Then check over your work.you hav a good argument but rong conclutionYou should read over your work to make sure that everything is correct.Make sure you read over the directions twice.Read over your fractions.Make sure your fraction strips are correct.Make sure that your fractions are correct.blu blu bluyou should give more infobecaus its denomonatolr is bigerShe is correct because 7-3=4 and 9-4=5She is correct because 7-3=4 and 9-4=5I think she is correct because 7-3=4 and 9-4=5. So I think she has the correct answer.15/21 is larger than 15/24 because the numberator is closer to the denomonater. When the numberator is closer to the denomonator, the faraticon is larger.You need to make the numbers multipy into something that the both can do.you need to multiply both numbers to make the sum the same number.you need to multiply both numbers to get the same sum or the same numbers. The sum always has to be the same for both numbers.You need to use the smallest number you can to multipy both numbers into the same sum. Make sure that when you multipy the numbers you always have the same sum for both numbers.Make sure when you multipy the numbers you have the correct sum and both numbers have the same sum. Always make sure the numbers have the same sum.When you multiply, you have to make sure the sums are the same for both numbers. Always make sure that the number you mulyiplinh by is as small as it can be.When ypu multipy, make sure you have the correct sum for both numbers. Also, make sure your you sum is as small as it can possibly be.Make sure when you multiply you multiply by the smallest number you possibly can. Always make sure the sum is the same for both numbers.You will need to find out what the two denomanators can both multipy into and then multiply the numberator by the same thing.Next time you will need to mutiply the numberaor by the same thing you multiplyed the denomanator by and thats the new numberator.You need to find the easiest way to make the denomanators the same. You don\\'t need to make the numberators the same though.You will need to make sure that you multiply the Numberator by the same thing you multiplyed the numberator by. You alson need to have the same sum for the denomanator. You will not have to have the same sum for the numberator though. Also, the least common denomanator is the number that both denomanators can multiply to get.When you multiply the denomanator, you need to make sure both denomanators make the same sum. the numberators dont need to have the same sum.I think that her picture is incorrect because she didn\\'t use common denomanotor. she has to make the denomanotors the same. Not add them together. It should be 10/40I think that her picture is incorrect because she didn\\'t use common denomanotor. she has to make the denomanotors the same. Not add them together. It should be 10/40+32/40=1 2/40To tell which fration is bigger, its the numberator that is closer to the denomanotorTo tell which fration is bigger, its the numberator that is closer to the denomanotor.what he needs to do is that he needs to multiply 6 times 5 and then get 30 and then it equals 3 and then muliply by 10She would have to do 21 time 1 which equals 21 and then 21 equals 7 and then multily it by 3First she would have to do 12 times 2 and then get 24 and then 24 equals 3 and then you would have to do 3 times 8He would have to multipy 5 times 2 and equals 10 and ten would have to equal 1 and do 10 times 1This is some advice is to find the lcd and to find if they are greater than or less thanthe one problem is that lester mixed up the graeter and less signs and the denominator where wrong also.he was right with the denominors butnot the numertorThat it is showing how to write fractions in this formBecause if you would simply both of them but since 32.65 is smallershe is wrong because you can not add the dinomators because then you will get the wrong answer and you can add the numorator but not the dimnator32/65 is larger becuse 65 is a bigger numberSix times two is 12 Nine times two is 18 so put the 12 on top and put 18 on the . then you get 12 18she needs to multply to get 30 and 5 times 6 equles 30She needs to multy 21 times 1 and is 21 and 7 times 3 is 21 . That is what i thinkShe needs to multy 12 and 2 is 24 and 8 and 3 is 24 . that is what i thinkhe needs to multy 5 and 2 is 10 and 10 and 1 is 10 . That is what i thinkI think he needs to muilty 5 and 8 and 5 and 9. That is what i think..That is how I got 40 over 72 and 42 over 72I THINK HE NEEDS TO MUILTY 1 AND 5 AND 4 AND 3. THAT IS WHAT I THINK . 12 OVER 20 AND 5 OVER 20I THINK SHE NEEDS TO MUILTY 7 OVER 8 TIMES 1 AND HALF TIMES 4 . THAT IS WHAT I THINK . 7 OVER 8 AND 4 OVER 8if you dont have the same domnators you cant subtract it and you dont subtract the domnators at all anyways so you dont subtract it at allthe smaller the domaters the bigger the friction and the bigger the domnators the smaller the friction so that is why 15 /21 is bigger than 15/24Kia is incorrect because she added the denomenators and the numerators. When adding fractons you do not add the denomator or you will get an incorrect answer.She also did not show this correctly in her picture. She deminstated what she did wroung in her picture. Therefore Kia is incorrect.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because of the denomators.If you were to cut a pizza 65 time the slices would be very small. If you cut the same size pizza into 45 slices they would also be rather small but,not as small at 65 slices. This is because 65 is larger than 45  so the cuts would have to be smaller to fit all of them.That is why 32/65 is smaller than 32/45.You have to keep the change the same. do to the numerator what you do to the denominator.Study your multiplcation facts.Then you will get the proplems correct  when doing fractions .Also what you do to the numerator you must do yo the denomator.You should read the directions more carefully so you multiply/divide right. Remember your math facts. What you do to the denomator yoy must do to the numerator.You should study your multiplication facts so your fractions will be right. Read the problem closer.She needs to read the problem closely and pay attention to what you are doing . Also learn your math facts.Do not divide but  but multiply to get the comman denomator.Pay more attention to what you\\'re doing. Also, don\\'t mix things up.You should try all the numbers before choosing your pick.Do not multiply the denomators.Pay more attention! Practice your math facts! Don\\'t be lazy!Do not multiply and divide on the same problem !And read the problem closely.Becareful when reading and study your facts for math.Read closelyYou should be more careful when multiplying numbers to make an equal fraction. You should probably also use quadrilaterals to compare.Study your mutiplycation facts read closely and compare better.sup computerRead the problem more carefully so you get all your mistakes right.Pay attention and LEARN YOUR MULTIPLICATION FACTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Also becareful when you are using fractions.Make sure you multiply correctly so you get the right answer.Kia is incorrect because she also subtracted the denomators. When subtracting or adding fractions, you do not subtract or add the denomators. This will give you an incorrect answer. Kia did subtract the numerators right though. Therefore Kia is incorrect with the answer to her problem,7/9-3/4=4/5.15/21 is larger than 15/24 because as the denomator gets larger the peices get smaller. Therefore 15/21 is larger or greater than 15/24.If you want to double something you have to times by twoShe should look at the directions.He needs to find the least common denomontor.7 at the problemyou have to find the smallest number that goes into each other numberhe want hththdo not make them smaller than they areLook closely at what it saysLook closely at what it saysumerratorMultiply  correctlywhat he doeshe denomonater he has to do to the nmerator to tALEXANDER YOU NEED TO  D0 6x5=30=3x10OLIVIA U HAVE TO DO 21x1=21=7X3YOU DO 12x2=24=3x8euhbrfbwujrfkia rshowed the right picturebecause the bigger the number is the leastBoth of the denominaters have to go into the new denomintater. Also, try to make your new denominater the smallest one possible.Make sure that the numbers can be multiplied to your new denominater. Also, make sure the lower denominater isn\\'t a factor of the larger denominater.Make sure that your least common denominater is not found by multiplying the denominaters and if you can\\'t find the smallest denominater, multiply the denominaters by each other.Make sure that your denominators are not multiplied by each other and check to make sure the smaller denlominator is a factor of the other denominator.Make sure that you do not put the false answer and make sure that what you are multiplying has the same product.Make sure you come out with the same denominator and you use the right numbers.Just because the denominater is bigger, that doesn\\'t mean that it is a greater fraction.When you multiply the numerator make sure you use the denominator from the other fraction.Make sure that you do not put the smallest number as your denominater because then your answer will be wrong.I think she is wrong because all the denominators are different.  When you subtracI think she is wrong because all the denominators are different.  When you subtract fractions you need a common  denominator.  You subtract the nemerator and not the denominator, since you have a common denominator.15/21 is larger than 15/24 because 15/21 has a smaller denominator, so the pieces are bigger then you get more in each piece.she has the right answer because she sowed that 2/8 + 4/5=6/13 and i made sower she did it right to .IT is a smaller fration of the hole peice of pizza because it is cut up into littler peicesu need to cont hyow many u sade in at a timeu need to look at the problem and focus and really makeb sents of itu need to count the inervolesmake shorw u look backlook overdo not gessmake shore u look overkeep tringdo goodtry your best and if u need help ask frindrobert did not mutipliy croletlyRobert did not multiply correectlyyou did not times by 2 in the second one you did times by 3 thoutyou did not times the numerator corrdtyyou did good equivelent fractions but next time try better on cmparing fractionsshe did it wrong because she had diffrent denoinators.bebecause it doos not have to be cut up more into littler peaices it is bigger than 15 24 .this is right because 9 - 4= 5 and there are 5 boxes in the last one, and 7- 3=4 and there are 4 in the last box to. so it is right 7/9 - 3/4 = 4/5.15/21 is almost 1 hole and is closer to 1 hole than 15/24.6 goes into 12 2 times and 9 goes into 18 2 times.5 goes into 10 2 times and 7 goes into 14 2 times too.2 goes into 4 2 times and 8 goes into 16 2 times also.4 goes into 8 2 times and 5 goes into 10 2 times.1 goes into 2 2 times and 3 goes into 6 2 times3 times 2 is 6 and 6 times 2 is 12.2 times 2 is 4 and 7 times 2 is 14.6 times 2 is 12 and 8 times 2 is 16.6 times 5 is 30 . 30 is 3 times 1021 times 1 is 21. 7 times 3 is also 21.12 times 2 is 24. also 3 times 8 is 24.5 times 2 is 10. also 1 times 10 is 106 times 2 is 12 also 3 times 4 is 128 times 2 is 16 also 1 times 16 is 1615 times 3 is 45 also 5 times 9 is 454 times 6 is 24 also 1 times 24 is 24.45/75 is bigger then 40/7212/20 is bigger than 5/207/8 is bigger than 1/28/12 is bigger than 3/1228/35 is bigger than 20/3512/18 is bigger than 6/189/12 is bigger than 1216/40 is bigger than 10/402/8+ 4/5=6/13 i know this because in the first box it has 8 boxse and the second box it has 5 boxes in the last box it has 13 boxes.32/65 is clocer to 1 holeShe did not see that.

When you do a fraction addition problem, you must find a denominator which both fractions have- a common denominator.  A common denominator of 2/8 and 4/5 is 40, since 8 x 5 = 40 and 5 x 8 = 40.  Then you must convert the numerators into the a fraction with a denominator of 40, also.  To do this, you must multiply the numerator by the number that you multipllied the denominator by to get the common denominator.  Since we used the expression 8 x 5, our 2 must be multiplied by 5.  2 x 5 = 10, so our new fraction is 10/40.  Then we must convert 4/5 into a fraction with 40 as the denominator.  Since we multiplied 5 by 8, we must do the same with the 4.  4 x 8 = 32, so our new fraction equivalent to 4/5 is 32/40.  Then we can add them together- but we cannot change the denominators, just the numerators.  10/40 + 32/40 = 42/40, or 21/20.  So, 2/8 + 4/5 = 42/40, or 21/20.h bhhyhybb n jhm nmcb nmb nb nmb bb n bn nb nm nmj mnSInce the wholes are the same size, and the same number of pieces are being represented, the smaller one will be the one which has smaller pieces.  If each whole is the same size (which they are), the one with more pieces will have smaller ones.  The denominator depicts how many pieces are in each whole, so the one with a larger denominator - 32/65-  will be smaller.  32/65 is smaller than 32/45.When you make an equivalent fraction, you must change the numerator and denominator the same amount of times.  For example, when you have 6/9, you must multiply 6 and 9 by 2 to get 12/18 instead of dividing 6 by 3 and multiplying 9 by 3.You must find a number with an equation to represent it from both denominators to find a common denominator.  Also, the common denominator must be able to go into each of the numerators.Olivia made the mistake of trying to do different operations while thinking they were the same.  She multiplied 21 x 7 and got 3, which is not correct.  Instead, 21/ 7 is 3.Kaitie forgot to check if there was a common denominator below the product of both denominators.  When you multiply two denominators together, you will always get a common denominator, but sometimes there is one smaller than the product of the two denominators.He must check to make sure there is not a common denominator below the product of the denominators.  Multiplying the denominators together will always result in a common denominator, but in some cases, such as this one, there is a common denominator smaller than the product of the two denominators.they have to equilit hasto equil the sameit has to be equilhithey are all evenboth numbers have to multiplyermultiplymulti plymultiplymultiplymultiply by 3multiply by 8 in the first one and 5 in the second onehe is wrongbecause 21 is closer to 15I think she is wrong because you can\\'t add two denomonators that don\\'t go into each other evenly.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because when the deomonator is a large number it is smaller than a smaller number.next time he needs to double it instead of triple it.double the denomonator instead of trippling it. the numorator was correct. She doubled it.double the numonator and don\\'t subtract one.make sure the denomonator goes into the least commen denomonator evenly.make sure the deomonator goes into the least commen denomonator.next time kaitie needs to make sure that the least common denominator is the product is both of the denominaters.Make sure the denomonator equales the least commen dewnomonator.the denominators both have to be \"related\". inthis case they\\'re both \"related\" to 10 so it\\'s correct.Make sure the denomonator equales the least commen denomonator.Make sure the denomonator equales the least commen denomonator.You have to make sure that both of the denomonators equal the least commen denomonator. You will know if you multiply the denomonators by a number and you get the same answer for both.next time lester needs to make sure that he knows that just because there is a the larger denominator doesnt mean that its the greatest fractionJimmy needs to make sure that both denomonators have the least commen denomonatora.Kima needs to make sure both denomonators go into the smallest commen denomonator.Leslie needs ton make sure that the denomonators equal the same loest commen denpomonator.I don\\'t think both numbers  go into 5 equally so you can\\'t subtract them.15/21 is greater than 15/25 because 24 is greater than 21. Sience 24 is greater than 21 it is cut up into smaller pieces. Sience it is in smaller pieces that makes the fraction smaller.no she is wrong. she added the denomonater. we never add the denomonater. the anserwr is 4/4if the denomonator is smaller the bigger the peacehe - the numerator but on the denomonater he did three times as much of 9alison had the numerater right but the denomonater was right  on the denomonater she did three times as much as the real ansewrshe minused the 2 and made it a one  but the denomonater was rightshe was corect on bothboth of the were wrongthe numorater was wrong sh 3x itshe added to muchyour numerater was right but not the denomonare was not you 3x itmake shur you are adding rightingmake shure to find the ansewryou are rightgoodtry not to add to  muchgood jobgoodgoodall of it wqas ridgtyou multyplyed rightgoodyour numeraters were wrong but every5thing els was goodgood thinkingthink about the numeraters mporegood thinkingingood of ball of them but the greator or less sign\\'she is wrong the real answer is 6/8the bigger the denomonater is the more pieces there is the bigger the numerator the more filled in2/8 + 4/5= 6/1332 timmes6532 timmes65       45 is smaler than 65                                                                                     32timmes45be more careful when you do problems and double check after you finnish and read the directionsit\\'s hared so make shoer that you look the anser up agenmake sure to be careful when you multiply and use your fractions for the correct answerthe lesser the denomanator the greater the amsweryou need to study more and look carefully at the questionsbe more carefull when you do your playground7-3=47-3=47-3=4                                                                                                  9-4=57-3=4                                                                                                  9-4=57-3=4                                                                                                  9-4=57-3=4                                                                                                  9-4=57-3=4                                                                                             _ _ _                                                                                               9-3=515-21=14                                                                                           15-24=-11I think tht this is not right because the diominaters are not the same so first they should fix the diominaters and then subtrate.Robert you need to learn to know equivalent fractions way better than you do ok. That is my advice to you. If i were you I would use what I told you.Alexander needs to go to school and if he does than he needs to hear what the teacher is saying. So this is what Alexander needs to work on.Olivia needs to to the same thing I told Alexander to do. Hear your teacher talking and follow dircsinsKatie needs to learn the common denominator. Also she would have got the problem rightWell Ryan you need to know your factors to get the problem. Also you if you make up your on least common denominator thing than you have to know what you are doing.I thing that Matt needs to do what I told Ryan to do.All of this kids need to leason to there teacher. Alos need to know what there doing.Does Effie know what the problem is and how to solve it.You need to learn how to do the problem.You need to learn your mutiple jyi ojjelwmcekfneWhat grade are you in like 4th. So you need to learn how to mutiple and to know fractons.You need to be in summer school. OK have you ever thought of that.GO TO SUMMER SCHOOL.Do you know how to do this because it does not seen like it.You are pretty smart but you need to learn how to mutiply.learnHow to mutiply.This is not true because the dinominater is not the same.This is true because 32/65 is farther apart than 32/45. So with that said 32/45 is bigger.I do not think Kia is correct because she subtracted the numorators and denomeratorsFifteen twentyfirsts is larger than fifteen twentyfourths be cause the smaller the denomarator the larger the fraction.Robert, you need to know that equivalent fractions are fractions that are doubled ,tripled , and so on.Alison,you need to know that you don\\'t just double the numerator,but also the denominator.Vanessa,you need to know to not subtrakad any part of the fraction to make an equivalent fraction.Alexander,even though 1 means a whole you don\\'t use it as a least common denominator.Olivia,the least common denominator is not the sum of the problem.Lester,the first fraction is not larger than the second.Jimmy,3x4 is not 18,it is 12.Kima,sometimes the least common fraction can be the same as the common fraction.Leslie,you do not add the numorator when you multiply the demoninatorD\\'Angelo,the first frqaction is larger than the second.Anne,once you find out that  what the least common denomanator is, use it as the denomanator for both of the fractionsDonna,once you figure out what the least common denomanator is,Omar,the first numberline is larger than the second.I do not think Kia is correct. I think this because she added the numarators and denomanators.Thirty two sixtyfifths is smaller than thirty two fortyfifths because the smaller the denomanator,the larger the fraction is.she is wrong beacuse you dont add the denomonators.32 over32 over 45 is closer to being a whole number than how far 32 over 65 is.Robert needs to know how to multiply correctly so he doesnt screw up any more problems.ALISON HAS PRBLEMS MULTIPLYING BY 7VANESSA HAS TO MULTIPLY BOTH NUMERS AND NOT DIVIDE IF SHE MULTIPLIES THE TOPMake sure you know your multiplication factsmake sure you multiply rightalexander is isisAlexander needs to know his multiplication facts betterMULTIPLY BETTER NEXT TIME jk just practie your factsKATIE HAS PROBLEMS PLACING EACH PRODUCT WITH THEIR FACTORS MILKSHAKESRyAN NEEDS TO PLACE THE LEAST COMMON DENOMONATOR AND NOT A BIG DENOMONATORSORT OUT YOUR FACTORSSORT OUT UR FACTGET YOUR FACTS STRAITGET UR FACTS\\'GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHTKia needs to have equal demomonators to get the problem rightSince 21 is less than 24, and 15 is closer to 21 than 24you should multiply the bottom and top by the same numbermultiply both the numerator and denominator by th same number :)do the same thing to the top and the bottomwhatever you do to the bottom you have to do to the topmultiply both by the same numberdo the same thing to the bottom and the topdo the same to the bottom and  topdo the same to the bottom and topnantry to use numbers that are allmultiples of each othertry to use numbers that all have something in commonuse numbers that all are multiples of each otheruse numbers that are all multiples of each otheruse numbers that all have the same multiplestry to use numbers that all have the same multiplestry to use numbers that all have te same mutiplesthe one with more purple is greaterthink about the larger one having more purple shadeed inlook at the number line to determine what number the point is atthe denominator has to be the same if it is going to be lcd for both numbersWhat ever shape has more shaded is biggerthe common denominator has to be the same for each numberwich ever nomber uis farther is biiger unless it has a higher numberthe denominator has to be the same if it is the lcdfirst, I wouls convert the fractions to the lcd.first, I wouls convert the fractions to the lcd.    7/9=28/36    3/4=27/36     28/36-27/36=1/36because the denominator is smaller, so that means that it isnt split up into as many groups of the other number. this means that each 15th is a little bit biggerKia is wrong because she is just doing imple subtraction and is not using common denominators. Since she is wrong the problem she made of graphs clearly shows that if she took 3/4 away from 7/9 she would get zero and not 4/5.15/21 is greater because the 21 denominator is bigger than the 24. If you have fraction pices that are 21 size you can tell that it is bigger than 24 even though in real math 24 would be bigger.You need to multiply the numerator and denominator in the same way and by the same number.Alison needs to multiply both numbers by the same number or else it will be wrong.If you multiply the denominator you need to also multiply the numerator by the same number.You need to multiply or divide fractions to get the correct answer.You need to multiply or divide fractions or it will be incorrect.Multiply or divide fractions.When finding equivalent fractions you need to multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number.You need to multiply to find common denominator for both of the fractionsWhen finding the least common denominator you need to either multiply or divide both fractions,so that you can get the correct answer.You need to find the smallest number possible that both the denominators can multiply to get it.You need to try to find the smallest number that goes into bothYou need to find the correct number to multi[ply the denominators in order to correctly answer the problemYou need to multiply both by the same thing.Even though the 9 is bigger than the 8,in a fraction the 8 would be larger than the 9.You need to multiply the fractions both by the same number.when finding the least common denominator for both fractions you need to find one that fits both denominators.leslie shpoulD\\'angelo need to do betterShe is wrong because if you added them with the least common denominator it would be more than 1, so the ending answer would not be correct.that fraction is smaller because even though in real math it would be bigger, in fraction math 65 pieces are much smaller than 45 pieces.Kia is correct because each denominator is the whole there and each numerator is shaded in.15/21 is greater beacause if you break 15 even peices from a whole of 21 peices you get bigger peices than you\\'d get from 24 peices.You need to multiply the numerator and denominator in the same way and by the same number.Alison needs to multiply both numbers by the same number or else it will be wrong.If you multiply the denominator you need to also multiply the numerator by the same number.You need to multiply or divide fractions to get the correct answer.Multiply or divide fractions.You need to multiply or divide fractions or it will be incorrect.When finding equivalent fractions you need to multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number.You need to multiply to find common denominator for both of the fractionsWhen finding the least common denominator you need to either multiply or divide both fractions,so that you can get the correct answer.You need to find the smallest number possible that both the denominators can multiply to get it.You need to try to find the smallest number that goes into bothYou need to find the correct number to multi[ply the denominators in order to correctly answer the problemYou need to multiply both by the same thing.Even though the 9 is bigger than the 8,in a fraction the 8 would be larger than the 9.You need to multiply the fractions both by the same number.when finding the least common denominator for both fractions you need to find one that fits both denominators.leslie shpoulD\\'angelo need to do betterI think that Kia is wrong because she added th e denominators.It is smaller because if you had to break something into 65 equal peices and take 32 peices from them you\\'d get smaller peices rather than if you broke something into 45 peices and took 32 peices out of it.Yes. This is because 2+4=6, and 5+8=13.The total number of pieces inside the circle ( fifths, for example) is the denominator. The number of pieces shaded is the numerator.The total number of pieces inside the rectangle is the denominator. The total SHADED is the numerator. So, how many pieces are shaded? 7. How many pieces in all? 9. So, the fraction would be 7/9, or seven over nine.The total number of tickmarks(big and small)= the denominator , and the numorator = what tickmark the dot is on.first you need to multiply 9 by 2 then 6 by 2 the you put the two in the correct palces then you have the awnserfirst you have to multiply by 2 u first multiply the numarater and the denominater by 2 and the you have the awnserYou have to double the numerator to get the answer.You have to multiply to get 30 or the number that both can multiply to get.you have to look at the numbers carefully the multiply to get the same awnserthe larger one was the 5 eights he put the greater than less than sighn backwordsthe denomaters are suppost to be the same numberBoth denominators are equivilant. Divide the first numerator and denominator, and multiply the second.Yes. This is because 7-3=4, and9-4=5.24 is a larger number in general, but in fractions 15/24 would have more space to cover. 15/21 would have less.i think that is not a way you would show how the addition problem would be solved because that is not how you would figure out the problembecause  the pieces smaller cause you are cutting them in halfmake sure you take your time and check over your workMake sure you look over your work and what you have wrote down.when you check your work you need to do both the denominater and numerator the right waydo not add the fractions or they won\\'t be equaldo not adddon\\'t do defferent multiplesmake sure you are multiplingdon\\'t multiply one by 3 and one by 2look at the fractions to help youtry using multiplestry different multiplesuse the multiples of bothuse a number bigger than the factorsuse the factor by multipling not dividingboth  fractions need to have the same denominatormake sure your multipling the same number for each the numerator and denominatorcheck the numbers with multiplesi think that you would not have a picture of an addition problem because it is not showing them what you would doit is larger because you are breaking it into less piecesshe subtracted the two numerators (7-3=4), and she added 9-4 which would equal 5. So, she got 4/5.15/21 is larger tham 15/24 because the numerator and denominator are closer to eachother. 15 and 21 are 6 apart. 15 and 24 are 9 apart. That could show that would you rather have 15/21 or 15/24 of a cookie.you need to multiply the numorator and the denominator the exact same times or it wont be equvilantmake sure you that if you multiply the numorator, the denominator has to be the samemkae sure you multiply the numorator and denominator with the same numberhii hope you do wellwhat is 9 plus tensupsuppppbe a try hardhigg bro,

multiply by 2.)for both the numerator and the denominator.Alison,you need to follow the same step for both numerator and denominator.Vanessa should mulitply the numerator by 2 instead of dividing/subtracting.He needs to practice finding the common denominatorShe needs the same common denominatorshe needs the look for the smallest denominator instead of taking the easy way outinstead

the denominaiorsthat is smaller because the denominator is bigger than the other denomatorI dont think it is right because they have to have the same denomnator.It is larger because 21 is bigger when you are using fraction circulsif say five sixths and you had to round up to what it equals wich has to be half of the other fraction.you have to look at your problem and see if you are right like 5 times 6 equals 30 or 3 times 10 equals 30 so you have to see that they both equals 30lester needs to look at his numerator and his denominator more or he will never get the answerJimmy has to look at his problem and count by that number until you get it.no because you have to have the same denmomator for the fraction  to make senes.it is smaller because in fractions 65 has smaller peces.I think

than 32 over 45 because 65 is greater than 45I think that it is wrong because the three rectangles are cut into differant sizes so u can not do it15/21 is bigger that 15/24 is because 24ths are cut

divided the denominators of the two fractions when you have to do the same techniqe to both the numerators and the denominators.you have to muiltiply the numerator and the denominator by the SAME number.You can\\'t multiply the numerators then divide the denominators.You need to have equivalent fractions on the two sides and both have the same answerHe needs to look at his fraction circle a little more carefullyhe needs to multiply correctlyFor her 4/5 she cant do 2/ + 3/. You cant add two fraction stripes and call them one in the equation aboveFor her 4/5 she cant do 2/ + 3/. You cant add two fraction stripes and call them one in the equation above and the answer would be 8/16 if you make all of them the same size.because even though the denominator is bigger on thebecause even though the denominator is bigger on the /65 dosent mean that it would be larger than the other one. actually because the thirty two sixty fifths has a higher denominator that means it is cut into smaller pieces.no because she added the denominatersbecause the bigger the denominater the smaller the picesesdo not count the unshaded peicesdo not count the unshaded partsmake sure the denomanator is bigger than the numaratormake sure the change is the samedo not  make the numarator smaller than the denomanatoryou cant put the faction incheck before you say its wrongdont add your denominatorsmaller the denomintor the smaller the piecesnever add dinomanators only add numerators.since 45 is smaller than 65 there would be more space left for the 32 in 65 than in 45.Dear Robert, You need to double your numerator  and denominatoryou should have made each problem equal to 30Dear Olivia, you should have made the answers equal .Do not multiply all the numbersDear Lester, the smaller denominator is the larger fraction .you ssssssshould haveShe showed it right.It is larger because the dinomanator is bigger.Kia is correct because  she counted the equal parts correctly. Then she shaeded in the number of the numerator. Also 7/9+3/4=4/515/21 is larger because if you cut a pie of the denominators of both numbers 21 is less than 24. Also 21 pieces will be larger than the size of 24 pieces.instead of dividing  6 from 3 you muliply 6 times 2. instead of mulipying 9 times 3. you should muiply 9 times 2.you need to see what can both numbers can go into like 5 times 6= 30 and 3  times 10 = 30you need to figure out what numbers go into both denominatori think she is right because it is showing on the problem is showing you need to add and her exspanation is showing that she is addingon 32/65 it is less than half and 32/45 is more than half so 32/45 is biggerthe peices that are not shaded are not the correct pecies of the fraction the shaded ones are the correct fractionfirst, some times you have to multiply your nuneratror and denominator to see if it is equivelent and you can divide toojust multiply the numerator and denominator rightpizzaFirst, you multiply and divide to equel the answer you are looking formultiply  not addmultiply by the same number for the denominator and numeratorI think that she is corect because she showed her work and that helped also she added her numerators correct and she added her denominator right too the picture she showed helped alot.its smaller because it is cut into more pieces even if its bigger its cut into more pieces which makes the fraction smaller.I think she is not corret because you never subtract the denominaiter. The denominaiter has to be the same to be aible to subtract.The lower the denominaiter is the bigger the pieces are.The bigger the denominaiteris is the smaller the peices are.Robert needs to start multipling the same number for    both the numerator and denominator.Alison has to multiply the same number for the denominator just as she did for the numerator.add rightaddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd rigggggggghtTo get the corret answer you have to get two numbers that multiply and get the same answer.You have to get two numbers that will multiply up to the same number.If the denominator is the same then the numerator will have to tell the differince.Jimmy need to multiply the same number he multiplied to get his denominator.I think her answer is incorrect. I think this way because you sould never add the denominater and if you want to add fractions with different denominaters you have to make the denominaters the same.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because the largger the denominater is the smaller pieces are so 32/45 has lagger pieces than 32/65 which leads to 32/45 is largger than 32/65.No because it\\'s not enoughIf you have 65 than 32 would only fill half of 65 but with 45 than 32 would fill almost the whole numberyou have to make the fraction equivalent and the denominator cannot be bigger than the numerator it would be impossibleokay your numerator is right but your denominator is wrong you multiplyed 7 by 3 next time just multiply your denominator by 2you have to muliply the first denominator with the next numerator and than multiply the second dednominator with a number to equeal to your answer from the first partthe largest number is the same for both denominatorsthe product of both denominators have to be a factor of both denominatorsthe product of both denominators have to be a factor of both denominatorsthe denominators have to be  a factor that equeals the same as your numberyour denominators have to have a factor that is equeal to your numberboth denominators have to have a factor that leads to the same numberthe denominators have to have the same factors to equeal the numberyou did very good but when you compared the fractions it was a bit offyour numerators were very offconvet the fraction by 8for the numerator you had to fin the multiplul that equealed to 12your comparing was wrongwhatever you do to the top you do to the bottomfind the number that equeals to 12your comparing was wrongI think it\\'s correctbecause if you ues these fractions on a pizza than 15because if you ues these fractions on a pizza than 15because if you ues these fractions on a pizza than 15/21 would have bigger slices and 15/24 would have thinner slices0ur advice to Alexander is that he should find the least common denominator first, then go back and do the equation. When we fixed Alexander\\'s mistake, we thought it was easier to find the least common denominator first, so maybe that can help him too. Keep on working hard!!!Our advice to Olivia is that she should figue out the least common denominator first, then do the equation. Make sure both equations equal the same product if it is set up the same way as this one, but if you don\\'t, you could have gotten something wrong.Our advice to Lester is that he should convert the fractions to find an equal fraction. Then, after he finds an equal fraction, he should use that fraction he just made because he would have a common denominator so it would be easier to figue out which one is bigger.Our advice to Jimmy is that whatever number you multiply to get the denominator, you should do the same with the numerator. If he would have done the same with the numerator, he could have gotten the right answer.I think that Kia shouldn\\'t have added the denominators because the denominators represent the whole and should have just added the numerators. Kia also can convert the denominators  to make a common denominator to make them easier to add.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because in 32/45 more spaces would be shaded in because the 45 in 32/45 is smaller than the 65 32/65.thay are all ewoll24fs are litilr than 21fsRobert errors were 2 and 27ths those were aspost to be 12 and 18ths.you need to do 10 times three edus  thirdy euyis five times six.Nets time you shod dubl the numbar how aevr mene timeshe shoid dobl the hovr mane timeskima shold dubl the numbar how evre mene timesthay are not all equl the is the smolist and she is addingthes is troa because the hirre it is the solle the pise isno,2/8 should be 10/40 and 4/5 shuold be 32/4032 is closer to 45 than 32 closer to 65you need to get smarteryou need to get smarteryou need to get smarteryou need to get smarteryou need to get smarteryou need to get smaaryteryou need to get smarteryou need to get smarteryou need to be smarteryou need to get smarteryou need to get smarteryou need to get smarteryou need to get smarteryou are really smartyou are smartyou did ok  we just had some adjustmentsyou are a hersheys cookies and creamyes15 is closer to 21 than 15 is to 24kia did not make a commen denominetor\\'sbecause the denominater is diffrent.He needs to multiply both numbers by the same numbeer.multiply both numbers by the same numbermultiply both numbers by the same numbermultiply by the same numbermultiply by the same numbermultiply by the same numbermultiply by the same numbermultiply by the same numbermultiply same numbermultiply same numbermultiply by the same numbermultiply by the same numbermultiply by the same numbermultiply by the same numbermultiply to equal the same numbermultiply to equal the same numbermultiply same numbermultiply same numbermultiply  same numbermultiply same numbermultiply same numbermultiply same numbermultiply same numbermultiply same numberDEYFGERGDSYEDSYFEDXCUYCHXUXFHCXFCDXUFHCUFECHXZUFCXZZCXDUXYDXZHXUHyou have to change both denominaters to the same numberBecause 32/65 is further away to bieng a wholeI do not thik she can because for fractions to have the right answerfor addng and subtracting you have to have a common denomonator.15/21 is bigger than 15/24 because 15/21 has iggger pices because their is less parts you have so the parts of 15/21 are a little bit bigger than15/24.robert needs to double the the new numerator and denomonater by 2alex needed to put a 3 instead of a 2hishe needs to make a least common denomonaterhe made the denomonater to biguse mathyour dumbcheck your workcheck your work and mayby to to schoolI bont think she can becauase she needs to find a common denomonater32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because in fractions the bigger the number is the smaller pices there are13X 5= 6513X 5= 65She shaded in correctly but did not say the answer.She shaded in correctly but did not say the answer.

Her answer is thrown off because, when you work with fractions you need to find a common denominator. What Kia did was she subtracted straight across. when you subtract fractions you can\\'t subtract or add straight across, or your answer will be wrong.The reason why 15/21 is larger then 15/24 is because if you would draw a picture for an example you will find that 15/21 is bigger. The  reason for this is because with fractions when one fraction has bigger numbers than the other one it is not bigger, because if you has a candy bar and cut it into 15/24 your peices will be smaller. But when you cut it 15/21 you will have larger peices.What he needs to do to get the promblem correct is he needs to think of a least common denominator. He nneds to think of what number he can mutiply the two numbers by to get the last common denominator.You can see what number you can multiply the two numbers by another number to get the least common denominatoryou first need to see what factor the both numbers have in common. When you figure that out you can find the least common denominator.What Ryan needs to do is find a common factor of both numbers. When he does that he needs to put the numbers in order so that the least common denominator is accurat.What he needs to do is find a common denominator between the two numbers. once Matt has done that he needs to put then in order to make the promblem accurate.What Lester needs to do to find the least common denomantor, is he needs to see 8 times what eaquals 72. When you do that you need to do the same to the numerator. So when you do 5 times 9 you get 45. So 45 is you numeratorWhat Jimmy needs to do to find the least common denominator is he needs to see what the denominator times what eaquals the other denominator. What you do to the denominator you need to do to the numerator.What Kima needs to do is find a factor between 2-4. when you do that you fine the number 8. What you do to the denominator you have to do that do the numerator.I think it would be easier fot here to find a common denominator than to doa picture. When you do a picture it could be easier for some people but i think juat finding a common denominator would be easier.32/65 is smaller then 32/45 because in fractions when there is a fraction with a big denominator and then a fraction with a small denominatoor the smaller denominator is bigger. When you do a picture for camparing that is always easier in my opinion. When you have a picture showing fractions the smaller denominator is always bigger. This is because it is easier to cut a chocolate bar inno 45 and it is ahrder to cut it into 65. And of corse you want more chocolate nd bigger peices because when yiu cut a chocolate bar into 65 you peices will be smaller abd you want bugger peices.no because its wrongbecause 21 is 2 less than 24um pay attencen to the dang lessencheck your answers because im not doing your workhey hows your day ps.if your reading this i mean youstop it NOWuugggplease make these people animated14-AprNumerator and denominator change is differentdd3estop iti know your wathching usdeeeddi hate you im done im done i quit im done i quit i dont care leave me alone i hate this im DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SDMKJjfeeee3because its logicKia started to add across but you have to find the least common denominator.He needs to get the numrator and the denominator the same by multplying by the same number.

This is how you do it, you will take 15*24 and 15*21 you will see 15*24 is larger.First of all, the picture does not make sense. As you can see, the 4/5 is much larger than the sum, which should be the largest. Second of all, Kia did the problem wrong. She added the numerators and the denominators, which is not the correct way to do it. The correct way to add fractions with unlike denominators is to first find a common denominator.  Then make the equivalent fractions. After that, only add the numerators, keeping the denominators the same. Reduce if neccessary. The correct answer to 2/8 + 4/5 is 1 1/20.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because the denominator 65 has more parts than 45, causing each part to be smaller. For example, if you have a giant meatball sub divided into 65 parts, and another sub divided into 45 parts, the parts will be smaller in the first sub. The numerators of the fractions may be the same, but the denominators give them different values.Robert, next time, multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number so that it is equivalent. If you want either the numerator or the denominator to be double, multiply by 2.Alison, make sure that next time you multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number. That way, you will get an equivalent fraction. Keep up the good work!Vanessa, make sure that you use either multiplacation or division when making equivalent frations. Be sure that when you are multiplying or dividing to use the same number and operation for the numerator and denominator.Raj, next time you do a problem like this, be sure to use either multiplacation or division, not addition or subtrction. For this particular problem, you need to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number, 2.Jamal, make sure that you use either multiplacation or division when making equivalent fractions. Also, be sure to multiply or divide by the same number for the numerator and denominator.Make sure that both denominators go into the number equally next time.Find a number that both denominators can go into and multiply to make equivalent fractions.Find the smallest number the denominators both go into then multiply to make equivalent fractions.Find a number that the denominators both go into and then multiply to make equivalent fractions.Find a number that both denominators go into and then multiply to find common denominators.Find a number that both denominators go into and then multiply to make equivalent fractions.Find a number that both denominators go into and then multiply to find equivalent fractions.Find the smallest number that both denominators go into and then multiply to find equivalent fractions.Study the problem and denominators carefully before choosing your answer.I\\'m curious as to what will happen if I type this.Make sure to check your work carefully. The LCD is the smallest multiple of both denominators.Make sure to check your work carefully before answering. Multiply the denominators, don\\'t add themMake sure to check your work. Or chew gum. It helps you concentrate.First, drink some coffee. Then chew some gum. After that, do the problem, and make sure that you have the same common denominator, and that it is the smallest multiple of both numbers. Check your work, then go to bed.Try getting some rest before you do the work. When you are ready to do the problem, make sure that you multply the numerators by the same number as the denominators to ge an equivalent fraction. Then you can compare. Make sure to check your work.Make sure to check your work after doing the problem, so you can see if you made any litte mistakes. Also, be sure to have a cup of coffee ready. You\\'ll need it.First of all, the picture does not make sense. If you look at the diagram, you can tell that 7/9 - 3/4 does not equal 4/5. In order to solve the problem, you must find the least common denominator, which is 36. The correct answer isFirst of all, the picture does not make sense. If you look at the diagram, you can tell that 7/9 - 3/4 does not equal 4/5. In order to solve the problem, you must find the least common denominator, which is 36. The correct answer is 1/36.15/21 is larger than 15/24 because the 15 parts in 15/21 are larger. The more parts a fraction has, the smaller the parts will be. Therefore, 15/24, which has more parts, is less than 15/21, which is greater.no, because 7/9-3/4 doesnt equal 4/5 because you have to find the least common denominator between the two which is 36 so it should be 28/36 and 27/36 = 1/36 sothat is what i think.what you do to the denomintator you do the numerator too.so what you do to the denominator you do to the numeratorfind the least common denominator that both number go into. 10 and 6 would be 30she needs to find the least common denominator like the largest number that goes into both denominatorsshe needs to find the smallest nubmber that goes into both denominators not just random numbers50 is correct but you want the smallest possible denominator 10find the lcd stands for least common denominatorfind lcd least common deninomatorfind lcd least common denominatorTHE LCD ILCDLCDLCDLCDshe is wrong because she has to find lcd (least common denominator) which is 40 because 5 only ends with 0 or 5 so 40 and then do 2 x 5 is 10 so the first one should be 10/40 and then you do 5 x 8 = 40 so you you have to do the you do to the  same for the numarator. so it should be 4x 8 = 32 so it looks like 10/40 + 32/40  42/40 but you have to simplifiy so your final answer is 1 1/20it is not smaller it is greater than 32/45 because if you mulipy you will get 1,440 and  32/65 = 2,080 so that proves that 32/65 is greater than 32/45I think she should find common denominators to show this easier.This is because 65 > 45 and 32 is farther away from 65 than it is from 45.You multyply both numbers by 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and on by one number.When you multyplied the 5 by 2 you should have multyplied the 7 by 2 also.Next time multypy both not just one.just multyply the numbers by 2 so its easyer.Find 2 numbers that when multyplied get the same product.Since the 3 will go into the 21 you can just do 21x1=21 still all you have to do is go 7x3=21Do 12x2 and thats 24 and since 8x3=24 you use 2 and 3 for your anser.Since 5 is a factor of 10 you just do 10x1 and 5x2.Since 4 and 6 are factors of 12 you have to finds its pair and your done.8 is a factor of 16 so you just have to do 16x1 and 8x2.15x3 is 45 so then you need to find out 9x what=45 and the anser is 5.Since 4 is a factor of 24 you find its pair and you just multiply 24 by 1.Find which product of 8 and 9 is the same.Multyply by the 1 in 1/4 by 5 because thats what you used to find 20. Then in 3/5 multyply the 3 by 4 because that is what you used to get 20.You leave the top the same and change the 2 into an 8 and the 1 into a 4.Your had the right denomantor just multyply the 3 by 4 and the 4 by 3.The denomantor was right you just multypyed wrong, it should have been 20 and 28Find the multipul of 9 and 6 that is the same. Then finds its pair and your done.She should just find comon denominators to make it easier.21 is less than 24 so the fraction 15/21 is bigger.doble the denomerater then do the same to the numerateralwes do the same to the numarater as dominaterfind the numb that goes in to bothe numbers evenlyshe needs to make sure that the least comman denomanator is equal with each numbermake sure that he multiplays the numareter and the multiple to grt the cooret answerso when u find lcd u halve to do the same to bothyes because 2 pluse 4 is 6because it has a bigger denomanatorI think this is right because if you do 9 - 4 you get 5. and then if you do 7 - 3 ou get 4. Put it together and ypu get 4/5.Sometimes if the numerator is to small,the fraction will be incorrect.Get the first answer right then look at the second step and see that 6 times 5 = 30 and 3 times 10 = 30.If you look carefully you wiil see that their is a three in the problem. So if their is a three, that means that something probebly devides into it.If you know that 12 times 2 = 24 and that 8 times 3 = 24, that basicly tells you what to do.If the first number evenly goes into the third number, you have your answer.If you know your multiplacation and divition, you would know what to multiply by and divide by.If you look at the fractions you would see that 8 times 2 = 16.Look at the problem, if you would see that the 9 would of diveded into something that was a factor of 15.If you were to look at the fractions, you would see that a 6 was missing from the problem.If you were to look at the fractions, you would see that those are all of the forms unsimplified.All you need to do is find the number that divedes into it evenly.You can see that one of them is already in simplest form. Now all you need to do is look at the line and see what fraction it is.All yhat you need to do is look at the simplifeid fractions.Look over the problems and you will see that they are already in simplest form.If you look at it, there will be an 18 in the problem.All you need to do is divide by the right number.That is the right answer because it maches the fractions.Because 65 is bigger than 45.You need to double both the denominater and the numeratordouble the numorator and denominatorfind some thng they each equal and say what number to multiply it byYou use multiplcation to find out what number both denomnaters go intoSee if you can find what number both denominaters go intoyou have to multiply by the smallest number that both equal the same numberyou have to multiply by the smallest number that when multiplied equal the same numberyou need to multiply by the smallestr number so that when multiplied they equal the same numberyou need to find what they each equal to see what the common denominater isyou need to find what they each =you have to multiply by the same number when convertingyou need to multiply by the same number when converting to get the least common denominatorsyou have to find the least common denominateryou need to find what they each equallook at the pictures if you have to. the second picture has more shaded in.She is wrong, because you first have to make sure they both have the same denominater  (common denominaters).  Also you do not add or subtract or do any opperation with the denominaters, you are only supposed to add the numerators or do any opperation with the numeraters. Lastly you have your answer.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because there is smaller pieces in 32/65 and there are larger pieces in 32/45 and even though the numerators are the same the amount of area shaded in is more because the pieces are larger so you are shading in more space and in 32/65 you are shading in less area because the pieces are smaller. Incunclusion 32/65 is smaller than 32/45.2/4+4/5=1 wholethe smaller the denomonator the bigger the fractin even if they have the same numeratorA problem like this is easy for exsample: 8/10 = 18/20 I know that it is becuase the numerater times two is your other numerater same with the denomonater5 times two =10 and 7 times two = 14 there is your answer 5/7 = 10/146 times what and 5 times whatyou should multiplyproduct of both denomonatersproduct of both denomonatersdenomonaters aren\\'t the sameask a teacher if you dont know what your doingnanwhat times 4 what times 24The larger denominator is the larger fractionTo convert the fraction, the numerator was addedThe lcd is the largest factor for both denominatorsTo convert the fraction, the numerator was addedThe larger denominator is the larger fractionThe lcd is the largest factor for both denominatorsTo convert the fraction, the numerator was addedThe larger denominator is the larger fractionIT IS LARGGER OR I SHOLD SAY BIGGERit is because the denomonater is smaller so the fraction is biggerI think that Kia is right because if you subtract 9 from 4  (9-4) you get 5. If you subtract 7 from 3(7-30) you get 4.4/515 over 21 is larger because it takes less work/numbers to get to one whole because 21 is less than 24.Dear Robert,   If the problem asks to double the numbers you multipy the numbers/number by two.Dear Allison, You multiplyed the denominator by 3, when you were supposed to do 7+7... not  7times3.dear Vanessa,   you subtracted from the numerator instead of adding 2 on to makde it double.adding itself to itself.yes because  kjgtrrrrrr7.yes because you have to add the filled in sections,and then all of the sectionsit is smaller because it takes

make sure you are adding subtracking or multiplying to get your awnserkia got it correct because she subtracted correctly  and that\\'s how she got the correct answer15/21 is larger than 15/24 is because 21 is smaller than 24 so 21 has more peices than 21 that\\'s why 15/21 is bigger than 15/24he should always make sure that the denomanator is more than the numeratoryou  should not always

know that if you do 10 times 1 then it will get you the same number and that number is 10that 2 time nothing would get you twelve  and that 6 times 1 would only get you 616 divided by 1 equals 16 and that 8 times 2 equals 16 so that is how you get 16 for your answer15 times one does not  get you 1 because if it would equal  1 then you would have to do 15 times 1 and that is how you would get 1he

put the  point on the line so that she gets the right answer.i think that they are all perfectly good and there is no problems with the picture.the number is smaller because even though that the denomenator is bigger does not mean that the other number is going to be bigger.I think she is wrong because 3/4 does not =4/5I think she is wrong because 3/4 does not =4/5.15/21 is larger than 15/24 because 21ths are larger pieces.nothingdoble the numrator and donominater.holaholahola coma eustasVictor will you go out whith

it isHe needed to mutiplie by any number I multipled by two  and he shound of got 12 18th.Alison needed to correct her problem because she mutiplied by two different numbers she multplied by2 and then she multipled by 3 so i tund the 21 into a 14.Some advice is he should of looked to see if 6 could mutipli anything and he should of thought that 5 can make 30 so then 30 is equile to 3 so than 3 times 10 should of gave tou the least common denominatorsome advice is that he should have loced at what numbers go into ten and five gose into ten and so that would be in the first box and 6 times 5 equels 30  would be in the leats common denominator and if you look at the ten 30 divided by 10 equels 3  so that would be in the last box so the order is 5,30,3.Some advice is that she should haved looked at 21 and the 7 goes in the other part of the proplem so we could not use the 7. Sice 7 is the only number that can make 21 than we have to multipli 21 by 1 andwe get 21 so that would be the least comomon denominator 21 equiles 7 so that would be our last anwser. the order is  1,21,7.The only thing that was rong is that is rong was he has a > and not a < signSome advice is that Jimmy multimlied by to different numbers and he should of divided by the same number.I think Kia work is all rite because she has the work and she added and subtracted thke she needed to.15 21 is bigger than15 24 because if you multiplied them then it would be bigger than one.kia is wrong, and that is because the answer will be more than what she is trying to answer. The answer I got is 6/40.that is because 32/65 has more parts in the fraction and those parts are smaller than the parts of the fraction in 32/45.you need to make sure both of the number = the comman denominators times and what it is out 6x5=30 and 3 x 10 = 30you need to match the denominators to the least comman denominators mutply by doing 21x1 7x3 and the both = 21she was not making the least common denominator shre had the largest common denominatorhe did the largest common denominator not the smallest common denominator.Matt put the common denominator too low.you have to make the fraction thatis supposed to be bigger, make it bigger than the other fraction.The denominators were not the samethe denomations that she did did not match the restthe denominators need to match, and you need to multiply the denominators.he made the larger denominator the larger fraction.the icd is the largest factor for both denominatorsI think that kia is wrong.that is because it has larger pieces in the fraction.NO because the bottom does not changebecause its has a bigger n8umber on the bottomwe think thet he has to times becase it had to be equishe needs to know how to times 2she needs know how to timeshe needed to times the numbers to get it rightshe needed to times the number to get 7she needed to timrs thr get 3ygeggfewhgewscwjhewhdtfhshe added wrong it should go 7+3=10beacause 15 21 has less shaded inYou can not subtract fractions with different denominators. Kia would need to make a common denominator for 9 and 4 like 36.It is larger because 21 has less little pieces than 24. 15 would cover more pieces in the first fraction than it would the second.He needs to find the smallest number they have in common.she needs to learn her math.She needs a tutor.She needs to learn her math.he needs to learn his math!!! and get a TUTOR!!!!!!HE used the largest numbers not the least {smallest} numbers.LEARN YOUR MATH EFFIE I MEan i dont know!She needs to study her math facts.LEarn your math!!GO BACK TO FIRST GRADE DUMMYdzfklhbakdhbjdGOO BACK TO KINDERGARDTE LOSERHE has to compare the fractions correctly not incorrectly.SHE NNEDS A TUTOR AND NEEDS TO LEARN HER MATH GO BACK TO KNIDERGARDEN NOOBShe should go over her multipaction fact familys.LEARN YOUR MATH NOOBYou can not add fractions with different denominators!It is because 45 will have less little pices to fill 32 while 65 will have more pices left over that are not part of 32.No because the denominators don\\'t match so it should be 46/40because 45 is closer to zeroChange with the same number,Multiply with the same number!use the correct combanation!He needs to get the right answer next time he gets a question like that beacause he now knows what to do now,He needs to do it correctly cause he gott it wrongshe needs to get right for the next answerShe needs to get right the question next timeHe needs to get it correct next time.that it is wrong because the denominators do not matchbecause they have to have the same denominator and that is why 15 over 21 is biggerNo, because you have to change the denomonator to the LEAST COMMON DENOMONATOR in order to find the real answer. Over all, you can\\'t subtract the denomonators.15/21 is larger than 15/24 because the larger the denomonator the smaller the piece.Make sure you are remembering the parts of a fraction and that the numorator is on top and the denomonator is on the bottom.Make sure you are doing the multiplacation right.make sure your multiplacation is rightMake sure you are putting in enough numbers for both denomonators to go into.make sure you are putting your numbers in the right place.Make sure you are doing the smallest product.Make sure you are doing the smallest product.No, because she has to change the denomonators to match and not add them only the numerator.because the higher the denomonator the smaller the peice9x2 18 9x3 27 9x4 367/9 3/4      28/36   27/36   1/36Kia is incorrect because 4 and 9 go into each other with the product of 36 for the denominator. 7/9 will be 28/36 and 3/4 will be 27/36. After you subtract you will be left with 1/36. Kia\\'s problem is incorrect.With the denominator smaller than the other denominator, the sections a picture would show would be larger than 15/24. The fraction would be filled up more than 15/24.Alexander needs to be more careful about how he does his work and check his work before he turns it in because he made a big error in this problem.Olivia needs to check her work before she finishes her problem. She didnt put the denominator in the middle and the multiple for the denominators were switched.make sure to check your work before you turn it in because you could do the problem correct but you could make a computation errorYou do not have to multiply both of the denominators for you can get the smaller denominator an have to reduce more.When you are comparing fractions the number with the larger denominator is smaller.  Make sure you check your work next time to prevent making this mistake again. Other than that mistake or error your work was excellent!Jimmy needs to rember  to mutiply the numerator.Also he needs to check his work for any errors because he could do the problem correct but make a small errorKima you need to have the LCD be the smallest  number that the denominators (that are already there) can go into. Please check your work thourghly.Don\\'t add the numerator or the denominator because otherwise you will get the wrong answer also because you have to multiplyKia is incorrect because the answer on the picture is smaller than 4/5. Since it is an addition problem,  this answer is incorrect.A number with a smaller denominator is larger because the spaces that you could show in a picture are larger and can put more space into those sections.I think the answer should be one over thirty-six because seven over nine and three over four and then find the least common denomonator and i got twenty-eight over thirty-six then twenty-seven over thirty-six and then subtract and get one over thirty-six.Robert,you must multiply by 2 for the numerator and the denomonator. You must not make the numerator smallerand the denomonator bigger.Allison,your mistake was,you multiplied 5x2=10 and then you did 7x3=21.Which should of been 10/14.you should of multiplied 10x2=14.you should read the directions more carefully..Venssa,your mistake was that you did not rea the directions and multiply 2x2=4.Alexander,you messwed up the problem by you multipling by 2 and that messed the whole problem up because you multiplied 2x10 and 6x2 and the numbers do not meet.Olivia,Your mistake was,you multiplied 3x1 and you got 3 and you where supposed to multiply 21x1=21=7x3.Kaitie,Your mistake was you multiplied 8 by 12 and got 96 and then multiplied 12 by 8 and got 96 when 24 was the real least common denomonator.Ryan, your mistake was, you mutiplied the wrong numbers.But the numbers should have been 5x2=10=1x10.Matt, your mistake was that you multiplied 4 x 2 =12 and 4 YOU SHOULD PAY ATTENTION.Lester,your mistake was you,multiplied by the wrong numbers it shold have been 72 as the denomonator and 45 and 40 as the numerator and should have been the less than sign.Jimmy, you mulitiplied  1x17 and 3 x6. You needed to multiply 1x5 and 3x4. Please pay attention.no because yno because you need find the least commmon dominater then add.because the 32 is going in to a bigger number so there more slices left.use your brain good luckuse your brain good lucku need to just mutplydo not addyou shoul not addmuptply by the same numberdo not add!!!!!!!!!!!!!good workgood luckgood luckgood goodgood jobdo not go smallest numbrer into bothhigood work4use in lentfractions to see witch one is biggeru should not addit is posible to not have a inglent frationdo not addU DIID greatdo notaddtry not addgreatno becausebecause 15go 21 to more timesI think she cant do it beacuse if the denomonators are different you cant subtract itdo not count none shodeddont count the non shadeddont count the markes in the line plotput in the numeratori dont now i yoused hint and multiply writemultiply by 2multiply by 2 pizzaits hard to multiply but do it ritehgvrvhev2hjcjinrvuewcnfvdont knowmultiply by he same numberdont add the demomonators32/65 is not bigger than 32/45 because the bigger the donomonatorDO YOUR WORK!!!!!!!!3 is not a multiple of 2196 is not the least common multiplehiThe least common multiple is twelve45 is larger than 40.the least common denominator is 20you should do the least possible numbershe multiplied the numerator by too much.when u find the least common denominator, whetever u do to the bottom u do to the topNo because the denominator 9 is already greater then the denominator 5.15/21 is larger than 15/24 because  the nomoratorn15 is closer to  the denominator 21.You just need to multiply by 2 to get a good awnser :).You just multiply by 2 to get a good anwser.If you multiply the first number by 5 and then just make sure your answer in the 1st box matches up with the 2nd and 3rd box.I don\\'t know how to give advise to Olivia about what she needs to do to get the problem corect.Write the multipls out firstdo as your teacher says and learn from your theacher.I don\\'t know how to explain what to do.I don\\'t kmow how to explain it.8-FebBoth of the denominaters have to go into the new denomintater. Also, try to make your new denominater the smallest one possible.Make sure that the numbers can be multiplied to your new denominater. Also, make sure the lower denominater isn\\'t a factor of the larger denominater.Make sure that your least common denominater is not found by multiplying the denominaters and if you can\\'t find the smallest denominater, multiply the denominaters by each other.Make sure that your denominators are not multiplied by each other and check to make sure the smaller denlominator is a factor of the other denominator.Make sure that you do not put the false answer and make sure that what you are multiplying has the same product.Make sure you come out with the same denominator and you use the right numbers.Just because the denominater is bigger, that doesn\\'t mean that it is a greater fraction.When you multiply the numerator make sure you use the denominator from the other fraction.Make sure that you do not put the smallest number as your denominater because then your answer will be wrong.I think that she should try to convert the denominaters of the fractions above into the same denominaters so that is easier to add. Also, if she different denominaters, she might get the incorrect answer when she adds the fractions above.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because the 32 is closer to 45 than 32 is to 65. So 32/45 is bigger than 32/65 because 32 is closer to 45.she added the denominators when she needed the lcdYou need to read the directions more carefully because you have to double it. That means you multiply by 2Alison you need to check your work because on the denominator you multiplyed  by 3 but it should be 2.None of the multiplation problems equaled one.Olivia is thinking of dividing instead of multiplying.You were  thkining of the product of both denominators.Lester you need tolook at the numbers more carefully and also look at the modles.Jimmy you need to multiply the by the same number for both the numerator and denominatorKima you did the laradest factor for both so be a little more carefully.Leslie you addled the numeraors instead of multiplyingshe needs to find lcd to add the numeratorsbecause 21 is smaller than 24 so when the numerators are equal 15 is closer to 21 than 24. also you could simplify the fractionsbecause 21 is smaller than 24 so when the numerators are equal 15 is closer to 21 than 24. also you could simplify the fractions.I think her answer is accurret because the model shows the same thing as the standard form so i see no problem with it.It is smaller because in fractions if the demoninator is bigger the fraction is smaller but if the numorator is bigger than that make the ffraction biggerIt is smaller because in fractions if the demoninator is bigger the fraction is smaller but if the numorator is bigger than that make the ffraction bigger.just mmultiply them both by twojust multipy them both by twomultipy them both by 2just multipy by 2multipy by twomultipy by 2multipy by 2multipy by 2find the least common denominator than find out what 6x what goes into 30 and than find out what 10x what goes into 3021 x what goes into 21 and than 3x what gives you 21mutipiply both numbers and see what both of them go intomultipy both numbers than see what they both go into to make equivelent fractionsmultiply both numbers than see what they both go into than make equivelent fractionsmultiply both numbers than see what they both go into than make equivlent fractionsmultipy both numbers than see what they both go into to make equivelent fractionsmultipy both numbers and see what they both go into than make equivent fractionsfind the least common denominatorfind the least common denominatorfind the least common denominatorfind the least common denominatorfind the least common denominatorfind the3 least common denominatorhihishe added the domarmater, but you are only suppose to add the numarter when adding fractions.Robert you must do the same thing the the denonator and the numerator like multpling by the same numberhe ned to start by finding LCD and checkig his workmake sure that the denmanator  by finding LCD and check your work.you relly need the check yor work also find theLCDRyan you need to start finding LCD and check your workLaster has no incorrect answers but you must also double check your work.Jimmy you need to do the same thing to the numerator because its a fraction rulekmia when you are working make sure you need to find LCD. Because 2 is a factor not a multiple.Dear Leslie,fnding LCD is very important when mulpilingWhen she is subtracting fractions, she always needs to find LCD and make her numbers right.Because if you draw a model 21 is smaller than 24 so if you shade in 15 you, you will see that 15/ 21 isgreaterHe needs to find LCD and make the right answer.She should pay attention to the two numbers in the problem.She needs to list the multplys of both numbers.list the mutiples from 5 then 10He needs to learn the smaller the  denomotor the greater.Pay attention to the deonmatoirthey added the denomatorthe larger the denomator the smaller the fractionI think Kia is not correct because you never subtract, add, multiply, or divide the denomenator.  Kia did 7-3=4  for the numerator and then she subtracted the denomenators.It is larger because the denomenator on the left is smaller than the denomenator on the right. It would take more time to get from 15 to 24 than 15 to 24.Robert needed to do the same thing to the denominator as to the numerator. we did 6*2 and 9*2 to get our answer.Alison needs to do the same thing to the denominator as to the numerator.My parter and I did 5*2 and 7*2 to get our answer.Alexander should of  done 6*5=30 and 10*5=30.Olivia should of done 21*1=21 and 3*7=21.Kaitie should of done 21*2-24 and 8*3=24.Rayn should of done 5*2=10 and 10*2=10.Matt should of did 6*2=12=3*4.Lester shouid of done 5*8=40 and 9*8=72. Then 5*9=45 and 8*9=72.Jimmy should of did 3*4=12 and 5*4=20.  Then he should of did 1*5-5 and 4*5=20.Kima should of did 7*1=7 and 8*1=8.  then she should of did 1*4=4 and 2*4=8.I think that Kia is wrong because she added the denomintors and you are never supposed to.  I thank the correct answer would be 5/5 or one whole because 2/8 is equal to 1/5 and there is 4/5.  the number model would then become 1/5 + 4/5 = 5/5.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because it would take more time to get from 32 to 65 then from 32 to 45.I think Kia is wrong,because you have to make the danometers equle to get your answerBecause 15/21 is fuller than 15/24Robert,  You need to multiply both the numerator and denominator by the same number. Then, to check it, divide that fraction by the number you multiplied it by to see if  you get the same answer.Alison, You need to multiply the denominator by the same number as the numerator to get the correct answer.Vanessa, You need to muliply the numerator and denominator by the same number to get the correct answeryou can\\'t add a number to the numerator and the denomantoryou cant add it, you multiplyyou need to havea multiple that goes into both 6 and 10.you need to find a multiple that goes into 21 and 3you need to find the least common denominator of bothyou need to find the LEAST common denominatoryou need to find the LEAST common denominatoryou need to find the LEAST common denominatoryou need to find the LEAST common denominatoryou need to  find the LEAST common denominatoryou need to compare them when the have the same denominatoryou need to not add the numeratoryou need to find the LEAST common denominatoryou need to  not add the numeratoryou need to not chose the larger denominatorKia is incorect,because you can\\'t add the denomanatorsbecause you have  more parts in 32/65 so it\\'s smallerI think the answer is forty-two over forty because the least common denominater is 40 and the multiply the numenator by how many times it goes in and then add.It is smaller because if you find the least common denominator and compare them 32 over 65 is smaller.you would have to multiply each by two to get a equivalent fraction to six over nine.you need to multiply each by two to make an equivalent fractionyou need to multiply both by two to get an equivalent fractionyou need to multiply both by two to get an equivalent fractionyou need to double both to get an equivalent fractionyou need to multiply two  to both numbers to an equivalent fractionyou need to multiply both by twoyou need to multiply by twoyou would need to look through the multiples of both numbers to find the least common denominatorypu need to keep one the same and multiply until you get that answertry to multiply each by every number until one matches bothyuo would know that since ten is a multiple of five to just multiply five by twoyou need to know the multiples of each numbersyou would keep one the same and multiply the other by twoyou would look at the multiples of each number to find your answeryou would leave one the same and multiply the other by how many times it goes into itlook for the least common denominatorwhat ever the multiple of something is multiply it that many timesyou need to look for the lcd and then multiply by how many times it goes inif twelve is a multiple of three and four just multiply the number by how many times it goes in to ityou would just look to see what is the biger numeratoricd is lowest multiple of each fraction to find you numerator and denominatoryou need to find the lcd then multiply by how many times it goes into ityou need to change to the larer numberthe answer is 1/36 beacuse the lcd is 36 then subtract to get thatIt is because they have the same numerator but the first denominator is smaller which makes it largeri think kia is wrong because these fractions are all the same hey all equal each other. Based on the picture you can tell that they are all the same by the length and space left over from the rest. this shows that 7/9-3/4 =2/9 or 1/4.15/21 is larger because the denominator is smaller which means the shape  spaces are bigger because they are being split up into big 21 pices instead of  24 smaller peices.lester, maybe to get this equation accurate, you can try subtracting each fraction to see which one has more value. You could also try to lok at the numerator to see which one has a larger value, and since the denominators are equivilent, the larger number would be the correct answer. - A guideJimmy, the error that you made can be fixed. Some advice would be starting were you made the mistake. The mistake you made was that you had 1/2 of the equation wrong. Istead of jumping to some conclusions, you should have taken your time to look at the equation. 5x_=20, the missing number, 4, has to be multiplied to the three as well. This is the sama as the fraction below. - A guide.Kima, there was alot you did right but, you needed to simplify 14/16 to 7 /8. As you can see 7/8 can not be simplified any longer, so you would have to add to 2/4 to make it 4/8. Now the denominators are equivilent. Now you can find out which one is a larger value. - A guideI think Kia is wrong. the enominator would be 40 because one is an odd number and one is an even number. it would not work as 13 as a denominator.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because the denominator is bigger which gives it less space to fill up. 32/45 is bigger because it has more space, and bigger spaces to fill up. And that is why 32/65 is smaller than 32/45.she is not right because you cant add the denomanators to get your answer.it is smaller because 32/65 has a bigger denomanator . also because it needs 33 more to make a whole as 32/45 needs13 more to make a wholehe needs to multiply the numbers by 2. and to uderstand that the numerator is smaller and the denomanator is largershe needs to multiply the nubers by 2 . and she needs to uderstand that her change is differntshe needs to multiply the answers by2 and she needs to know that the numarator is smaller and that tthe denomanator is largershe

make changesshe is right becase 7-3=4 and 9-4=5its largerbecaese 15/21 is closer togther than 15/24What I think is that Kia is wrong because she subtracted the numerator and the denimonator instead of finding the least common denimonator to get the answer 1/36.15/21 is larger than 15/24 because if you imagine a pie that has 15/21 slices left the pie pieces are going to be bigger than 15/24 pie left.What Robert need to do is double the fraction , instead of trippling themWhat Alison needs to do is not multiply the numerator and denominator by two different numbersWhat Alexander needs to do is check his work propleyThe least common denominator has to be biggerNext time try to make a smaller least common denominaorHe made the denominator to bigYou need to check your workCheck your workCheck your workCheck your workWhat I think is that KIa is wrong because the she just added the numerator and denominator to get 6/1332/65 is smaller than 32/45 because 32/65 has a bigger denominator than the fraction 32/45.She is incorrect because she added the denominators.Because the denominator is largerhe needs to multiply thenumerator and denominator by 2She needs to multiply the

denominators the same before you add.becausebecause 32 is closer to 45 than 65i think that this is wrong because 4/5 is bigger than 3/4 which would mean that the answer that kia got was wrong.next time he needs to double it instead of triple it.double the denomonator instead of trippling it. the numorator was correct. She doubled it.double the numonator and don\\'t subtract one.make sure the denomonator goes into the least commen denomonator evenly.make sure the deomonator goes into the least commen denomonator.next time kaitie needs to make sure that the least common denominator is the product is both of the denominaters.Make sure the denomonator equales the least commen dewnomonator.the denominators both have to be \"related\". inthis case they\\'re both \"related\" to 10 so it\\'s correct.Make sure the denomonator equales the least commen denomonator.Make sure the denomonator equales the least commen denomonator.You have to make sure that both of the denomonators equal the least commen denomonator. You will know if you multiply the denomonators by a number and you get the same answer for both.next time lester needs to make sure that he knows that just because there is a the larger denominator doesnt mean that its the greatest fractionJimmy needs to make sure that both denomonators have the least commen denomonatora.Kima needs to make sure both denomonators go into the smallest commen denomonator.Leslie needs ton make sure that the denomonators equal the same loest commen denpomonator.What you do to the top you to the same to the bottomHe multyplied wrong numbers to be even and the lowest.check your multiplyingShe needs to multypliy her numbers smaller.multiply smaller.hiHe needs to learn his facts.go back to 3rd grade24 X 6 IS NOT 24 GO TO 1ST GRADE!!!!GO BACK TO FIRST GRADE!!!!!u stink at math!!LEARN YOUR MATH YOU ACT LIKE A PRESCHOLLER THAT IS IN DAYCAREU R SO DUMB LEARN UR MATH!!!!GOSH YOU NEED TO LEARN YOUR MATH WHAT GRADE ARE YOU IN??? OH PROBLY THE SAME GRADE AS ME 4TH??? WELL YOU DONT ACT LIKE IT!!!! YOU SHOULD BE IN SUMMER SCHOOL AND BE HELD BACK A LOT JUST LEARN YOUR MATH YOU LITTLE BABY!!!!!!GOSH YOU NEED TO LEARN YOUR MATH WHAT GRADE ARE YOU IN??? OH PROBLY THE SAME GRADE AS ME 4TH???/ WELL YOU DONT ACT LIKE IT!!!! YOU SHOULD BE IN SUMMER SCHOOL AND BE HELD BACK A LOTJUST PAY ATTENTION MORE!JUST LEARN YOU MATH OR YOU WILL BE HELD BACKGOSH U R SO HORRIBLE AT MATH!!!!! GO BACK TO FIRST GRADE!!YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS NEED TO LEARN YOUR MATH!!!you can only subtract with the same denominator. she also subtracted the denominators which you should not do.the denominator 24 is bigger than the denominator 21No.No.  She is incorrect because she did not to the math correctly.No.  She is incorrect because she did not to the math correctly.  Instead, she added the numerators, 2 in 2/8 and she added the 4 in 4/5 and got the 6 as in 6/13. Then she added the denominators, the 8 in 2/8 and the 5 in 4/5 and then she added 5 plus the 8 and got 13.No.  She is incorrect because she did not to the math correctly.  Instead, she added the numerators, 2 in 2/8 and she added the 4 in 4/5 and got the 6 as in 6/13. Then she added the denominators, the 8 in 2/8 and the 5 in 4/5 and then she added 5 plus the 8 and got 13. That is not the correct way to do it. Her pictures are correct. She shaded the correct part and she did not shade any extra rectangles/squares. She also had ther right amount of parts separated. Kia\\'s math is wrong, but for the incorrect math, her pictures showed 2/8 with 2 out of 8 shaded and in 4/5 she has 4 out of 5 pieces shaded. Her incorrect answer, 6/13 was shaded correctly, also. Kia is half correct and half not.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 for many reasons.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 for many reasons. For example, first you had 65 people attending your party. 45 RSVPed. You cut it into 45 pieces but when you have to cut more to fit all 65 people,32/65 is smaller than 32/45 for many reasons. For example, first you had 65 people attending your party. 45 RSVPed. You cut it into 45 pieces but when you have to cut more to fit all 65 people the pieces become smaller.He needs to find the least common denoiminator so they will both be equal. He also needs to find they multiples and factors.Next time, Olivia tries to find the least common denominator, she needs to look at her numbers more carefully.  She had the 1 and the 7 mixed up.Next time, Kaitie needs to compare 12 and 8 with the factors and multiples of 8 and 12 and find there simallarities.Next time Ryan needs to try more than just one combination.Next time, Matt needs to go over his facts again because all of them were incorrect.Next time, Brad needs to look at the fractions up top and then he needs to then compare.Since 15 and 9 are not divisible, the correct answer has to be because 3 is both divisible with 15 and 9.Sally had the largest number that goes into both denominators.  Sally needs to find fact families.Next time, Lester needs to know that the smaller the fraction the greater it is.Jimmy needs to know that the same thing Lester needed to learn. That the larger the fraction the smaller the amount.Kima had that 2/4 is equal to 1/2 and it is but 4/8 is more like 7/8 than 2/4.Leslie should study her facts and know them so she can more likely to get the common denominator right.Kia is right. She did the subtraction correctly and she got the pictures correct. Kia knows her fractions.Kia is right. She did the subtraction correctly and she got the pictures correct. Kia knows her fractions.15/21 is larger than 15/24 for a reason. For example, draw a rectangle. (Use lined paper) In the middle draw a line. In both sections, draw the parts into both with 21 pieces. Then, you will see that it is the same. Then 3 more peps come and you have to make each piece smaller. So, 15/21 is larger than 15/24. P.S. the pieces are peeps the chicks. IT\"S A PEEP CAKEi know that for the numerators 2+2=4 and 4+2=6 andI know that the numerator should not be shown by the non-shaded pieces.It shoud be the shaded  peices that you are suppost to count for the numorator.That is how I know that Jordan is wrong.robert said 2 over 27 witch was wrong. it shoud have been 12 over 18 becuase it says make an equivalent fraction to the given fration witch is six over nine.it also states that you have to double the numerator.6 and multiplyed by 2 and 9 multipyed by 2the rule is the larger the denominator is the smaller the  fraction and the smaller the denominator is the bigger the fraction is.if the denominators are the same.look at the num. and see wicth one is larger.then you can put > or <.she is wrong.she is wrong becuase 4 is not half of 9 it is half of 8 ,but 8 is not the denomorator of 7/9.just because they have diff. denomer. does not mean you can not sub..you could divied 9 if it was an even number, to 4 and make it an equivilent fracNo because 4/5 is bigger than 6/13 so when you add on 2/8 it is much larger than 6/13.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because yhe smaller the denominator is the bigger the parts are when put in a model and 45 is smaller than 65 so it has larger peices.He needs to multiply 9 by 2 and 6 by 2 to find the correct answer.Multiply 7 by 2 instead of 3 and leave 5 the same.She should multiply instead of dive the 2 by 2.Multiply by 2 instead of add 3Multiply by 2 instead of adding 2.denominator should be the loest number 6 and 10 could go intoShe should of found the largest number both numbers can fit intoshe should find the loesfind the lowest nuber both can fit infind the lowest number both can fit intofind the smallest nimber that they both fit intofind the smallest nimber that they both fit intofind the smallest number that goes into both numbersfind the smallest number that goes into boththe smaller the denominator is the bigger the value is depending on the numeratorinstead of adding he should multiply the numeratorshe should find the smallest multiple of both denominatorsdont add the numeratorthe smaller numewrator wiill always be larger if the  numerators are the samea lcd is the smallest multipleboth denominatorsmultiply instead of add the numeratorn0the smaller a denominator is the bigger its parts areFirst you need to erase the 2 shaded pieces. Then put five shaded pieces into five squares. There! Now your done making five pieces shaded in. The fraction will look like this 5/7.First you need take away 2.Then you need to take away the 27. After you take away the numerator and the denominator you need to do 6*2= 12. I did this because it says to make an equivelent fraction where the numerator is double. Then do 9*2=18.Put 12 as tYou have to make something like a line plot or fraction circle. You have to do this with both of the fractions. Compare then to each other. The one that is bigger is the right answer.the lollypop  tasted very good to me.Jimmy is not smart enough to do this problem.lilly loved loliy pops dose she have the same amount of loly pops does she want ice creamjcndsjlkfvnlkasngljernglkjdhglrehlghleriugfjnglgeruhvlkjerNo the fractions dont have the same denominator so kia could not do her problem that waybecause it would be a diffrent wholeif kima would do that there for she was wrong again if kia were to put that on her test her teacher would mark it wrong and  becauswhy 32 65 is bigger than 32 45 is 65 is a greater number than 45 so there for the cokie monster ate more2+4=6. 6 is the numerator. The denominators are not the same.it is smaller because the denoinator 45 and 45 is less than 65. that is why it is smaller.Dear Robert, your fractions are not shaded correctlyDear Alison,Dear Vanessa,dear rajdear jamalvictor,mary,otis,alex,olivia,katie,hdihfiksmattbradeffiesallyLester......JIMMY,KIMA,LESLIE,DANGELO,ANNEDONNA,OMAR,Kia had added the denominators. She had the top part correctIt is larger because the denominator 24 is bigger than the denominator 21.you cant add them they dont have common denominatorscince 21 is less than 24 the pieces in  the number 21 are going to be largerI know that the nmerater is how many you shade inyou have to mulitlpy the numerator and denominator by the same numberyou need to mulitply the numerator and denominator by the same number to get an equvelent fraction. insted of doubling the fractoin she tripled the fractionyou need to mulitply the numerator and the denominator by the same number to get an equvelent fractionyou need to find a common muilple then you find themulitple that can go in to that numberyou have to mulitply the numerator and the denominator by the same number to get an equivelnet fractionyou have to use the common denominator and see how many time the other denominator goes in to the new one. the multiple the nemenator by that number and you will get the problem rightkima needs to mulitply the numator and the denomiator by the same number to get the problem rightyou have to use the common denominators for your fractionyou have to see how many times the denominator goes in to the new one and the multiply the numinator by that number to get the answer rightwhen it says ADD you ADD THE FRACTIONS NOT SUBTRACT THEMyou have to see how many time the old denominator goes into the new one then muiloy the numminator by the number to get it correcti dont think so because they dont have common denominatorssince the denomin ator is larger the pieces are going to be smallerKia is corret wiht her work beacuse 7/9-3/4=4/5 no matter what you do.15/21 is larger than 15/24 beacuae 21 is less than 25 but im math terms in consitered larger.make sure you take your time and check over your workMake sure you look over your work and what you have wrote down.when you check your work you need to do both the denominater and numerator the right waydo not add the fractions or they won\\'t be equaldo not adddon\\'t do defferent multiplesmake sure you are multiplingdon\\'t multiply one by 3 and one by 2look at the fractions to help youtry using multiplestry different multiplesuse the multiples of bothuse a number bigger than the factorsuse the factor by multipling not dividingboth  fractions need to have the same denominatormake sure your multipling the same number for each the numerator and denominatorcheck the numbers with multiplesI think that it would be a lot easier for Kia to find the least common denominator for the fractions 7/9 and 3/4 before subtracting them. Also, I think she might get messed up using the pictures.15/21 is larger because  the number 21 is smaller than the number 24. I know this is correct because in fractions the smaller denominator is part of the larger fraction.Robert needs to multiply the numerator and denominator by 2.Alison needs to multiply the numerator and denominator by 2Vanessa needs to multiply the numerator and denominator by 2Raj needs to multiply the numerator and denominator by 2Jamal needs to multiply the numerator and denominator by 2Victor

is her answershe needs to do 2+2 =4 then she needs to do 8*2=16She needs to do 4+4=8 and 5+5=10 so her answer would be 8 tenthsshe needs to do 6 times 5 times 30 times3 that is what  she should have doneIf Olivia did 21 times 1 it would be 21 if you did 7 times 3 =21 so they both will have a denominator of 21If you do 12 times 2 =24 and if you do 8 times 3 =24 so your answer is 24If you do 5 times 8= 40+5 =45 that answer is 45 over 72 and 5times 9 = 45-5 =40 so your answer is 40 over 72If you do 4 times 3 =12 and 5 times 4 =20 so that answer is 12 over 20 and 1 times 5 =5 and 4 times 5 = 20 so that is 5 over 203If you add 2+4=6 in math you never add the denominator never ever ever add it you can add the numirator  but not the denominator32 over 65 is larger than 32 over 45 that is smaller so 32 over 65 is larger than 32 over 45no that is incorrect because you dont add the bottom denomenators or nemoratersItis smaller because the denomenator is biggers that means more to fill

the least common denominater you need to make sure you get the same answer for both numbers.When you multiply to get the same denominater you need to make you end up with the same answer.before you get a large multiple try to get the smallest one first.Try your best to get the same denominator ,but the smallest one you can.Just keep trying your best everyone makes mistakes.everyone makes these mistakes never give upYou should have the same answer for each denominater.Recheck your findings.to multiply what you multiply the denominator bymake sure they end up with the same denominator.ydo not add the numeratorCheck your resultstry your best stay positiveNot sure21 is smaller than 24 so the space is larger becase it has less spaces than 24.multaply the original numbers by 2he needs to multaply to 30she needs to know 21x1she has to give a  better multiplication anwser that is reson ablehe needs to find the smallest multaplewell i do highly disagre with kia cause the first thing you have to do in a problem is get coman denominators then you can start the equation but my anwser would be 32 and 45 as my anwsercause if you multiply in an equation of15 and 21 you will get a bigger numberI think she is right. I think this because 7-3=4, and 9-4=5.That is what I think about  is she rirht or wong.I  think that  15/21 is large  than15/24 because there is  21 bigger pices than 24 smaller pices. That is what I think about why 15/21 is larger than 15/24.So if you do this for an example 6x2=12. Then what you do to the top you do to the bottom.So it  would be this 6x2=12,then 9x2=18 so the answer is 12/18.What you do to the top you do to the bottom. For example 5x2=10, and 7x2=14. So the anwser is 10/14.I hope you understand what you did wrong.What ever you do to the top you do to the bottom.For example 2x2=4,and 8x2=16.So I hope you understand that what ever you do to the top you do to the bottom. I hope you understand why you where wrong.So  what ever you do to the top  you do to the bottom. For example 4x2=8,and 5x2=10.So I hope you understand why you  got this wrong.S what ever you do to the top you do to the bottom.For  example 1x2=2,and 3x2=6.So I  hope you understand why you got this wrong.So what ever you do to the top you do to the bottom. For example 3x2=6,and 6x2=12.So I hope you understand why you got this problem wrong.What ever you do to  the top you do to the bottom.For example 6x5=30,and 3x10=30.  30=30. So I hope you understand why you got this wrong.What ever you do to the top you do to the bottom. For example 21x1=21, and 7x3=21.21=21. So I hope you understand why you got this wrong.What ever you do to the top you do to the bottom.For example 12x2=24,and8x3=24.So I hope you understand why you got this wrong.What ever you do to the top you do to the bottom. For example 5x2=10,and10x1=10.So I hope you understand why you got this wroung.What ever you do to the top you do to the bottom. For example 6x2=12,and4x3=12. So I hope you understand why you got this wroung.What ever you do to the top you do to the bottom.For  example 8x2=16,and 16x1=16. 16=16.SoI hope you understand why you got this wroung.What ever you do to the top you do to the bottom. For example 15x3=45,and 9x5=45. So I hope you understand why tou got this wroung.What ever you do to the top you do to the botom. For example 4x6=24,and 24x1=24.So I hope you understand why you got this wroung.What ever you do to the top  you do to the bottom.For example 5x8=40,and9x8=72.So I hope you understand why you got this problem wroung.What ever you do to the top you do to the bottom. For example 3x4=12,and5x4=20.So I hope you understand why you got this wroung.What ever you do to the top you do to the bottom. For example 7x1=7,and8x1=8.So I hope you understand why you got this problem wroung.WHAT EVER YOU DO TO THE TOP YOU DO TO THE BOTOMMwhat ever you do to he top you do to the bottomwhat ever you do to the top you do to the bottomwhat ever you do to the top you do to thebottomwhat ever you do to the top you do to the bottomI think she is not correct. I know this because 2/8 is the same as 1/5. So it would be hole or 1, and the drawing does not even look the same as  what they say it looks like.So U hope you understand why tou got this problem  wroung.It is smaller because 45 is smaller than 65. There  are 45 smaller pices and there are 65 bigger pices.good because it is pretty much the same thing as tbe topbecause the picture would be biggerhe needs to break down the promblemjust times 6 by 5 and 10 by 3 to get 30just times 21 by 1 and 3 by 7just times 12 by 2 and 8 by 3just times 5 by 2 and 10 by 1just times 6 by 2 and 4 by 3just times 8 by 2 and 16 by 1just change the greater than sign to less thanjust times 3 by 4 and 1 by 5just times 2 by 4 and 1 by 4 and 8 by 1 and 7 by 1just times 2 by4 and 1 by 3just add the greater than signjust add 18 and times 3 by 2 and 4 by 3just times 3 by 3 and 3 by 2just add the less than signI THINK she is wrongbecause the denominator is largerI think she is correct because if you take you time and count correctly it does say what she said it doesI think she is correct because if you take you time and count correctly it does say what she said it does.When the denomoater is lower that means that the fration is larger.

Because 2 is a factor not a multiple.Dear Leslie,fnding LCD is very important when mulpilingno because you have to find LCD and you don\\'t add the denomators32 is 33 away from 65 and 32 is only 13 away from 45yes. 2 plus 4 = 6 and 8 plus 5 = 13 so that makes 6yes. 2 plus 4 = 6 and 8 plus 5 = 13 so that makes 6yes. 2 plus 4 = 6 and 8 plus 5 = 13 so that makes 6yes. 2 plus 4 = 6 and 8 plus 5 = 13.itis\\'nt 32 is closer to 45 not 65.you have to multiply the 6 by 2 and the 9 by 27 multiplied by 2 = 14 not 21. 7 multiplied by 3 = 21.the 1st number line is 2/8 but the other is 4/16 because 2/8 multiplied by 2 is 4/16.it\\'s 6 times 5 = 30 not 6 times 3 = 18.3 times 7 is 21 so 21 would have to be multiplied by 1 to get 21.12 times 2 is 24 24 is the least common denominator so the it would be 8 times 310 is the least common denominator12 has a 2 at the end wich is the least common denominator.8 can go in to 16 and so can 16.Your right exept its < not >.5x4 is 20 and 4x5 but you forgot to times 3 by 4 and 1 by 5.14/16 is the bigger fraction .you didn\\'t add the numerator right.it was <.you got the denomonaitor wrong.No.You can\\'t subtract a fraction if they have different denominators.15/21 is bigger because 15 is closer to 21 then 24.That is wrong bcause she has to find like denomonaters.Because 15 is closer to 21 than to 24.If you want to double something you have to times by twoShe should look at the directions.He needs to find the least common denomontor.7 at the problemyou have to find the smallest number that goes into each other numberhe want hththdo not make them smaller than they areLook closely at what it saysumerratorLook closely at what it saysMultiply  correctlywhat he doeshe denomonater he has to do to the nmerator to tshe has to make them have like denomonaters.Becuse 32 is closer to 45 than to 65k                                                                                      k                                                                                      k                                                                                      k                                                                                      k                                                                                      kHe needs to times the denominator by the numirater then he might get his answer.She should try to find the least common denominator by doing 21 times 1 =21 =7 so 21 is the least common denominator.You need to see if the denomantor is smaller than the other denomantor or you could cross multiply.You can cross multiply or see witch denomantor is bigger.You times the denomantor  and the numirator by the same nummber.I think she is right.If you cross multiply 15/21 is larger than 15/24.no it is 1/36a smaller demomenator is greater than a bigger oneyou should multiply more carefullyfind a number that is a productfind a product that both numbers sharefind a product that both numbers sharedont mulply them togetherdont just multipy them togetherdont mix up numbersdont mix up numbersdont mix up numbersgo lowerdont mix up numbersif the denominator is the same numerator winsmultiply more carefulyif one demonator goes into the other the bigger demonator is the leastmulitply the fraction by the same numberif the demoniters are the same the bigger numerator is greaterthe demonators must be the sameyes32\\\\65 is smaller because it has a bigger demonatori think that she is correct because she showed it but they don\\'t have commond denomonaters so she\\'s half right.i know that 65 is bigger than 45 so 32/65 are bigger than 32/45jordon needs to have 2/7 but he had 5/7chris did 2/9 but the answer is 7/9norman did this he didnt count the 1 tick marksyou had to shade 1/8 to help johnwe had to find roberts mistakeHer mistake is the she had to double the number but she had to take away for the 21we figure out the awnser is 4/16what lester had to do was he had to the answerWE HAD TO FIX JIMMYS MISTAKES BEACAUES 1/4 IS EQUAL TO 5/20we had to fixkima\\'s least common denomernatorthat she got the awnser correct and i undersstand her proccesbeacause of the denomanatorit would be 0 because7/9 are = to 3/4 so 7/9 -3/4 = 0when cuting 15/24 you have to make it smaller so  it is epual  so when cuting 15/21 you have to make it bigger0ur advice to Alexander is that he should find the least common denominator first, then go back and do the equation. When we fixed Alexander\\'s mistake, we thought it was easier to find the least common denominator first, so maybe that can help him too. Keep on working hard!!!Our advice to Olivia is that she should figue out the least common denominator first, then do the equation. Make sure both equations equal the same product if it is set up the same way as this one, but if you don\\'t, you could have gotten something wrong.Our advice to Lester is that he should convert the fractions to find an equal fraction. Then, after he finds an equal fraction, he should use that fraction he just made because he would have a common denominator so it would be easier to figue out which one is bigger.Our advice to Jimmy is that whatever number you multiply to get the denominator, you should do the same with the numerator. If he would have done the same with the numerator, he could have gotten the right answer.she has to make them commenwhen cuting a somthing you have to make it equall so cutting more will make it smallershe cant because you cant add fractions that have different denominatorshe cant because you cant add fractions that have a different denominatorthe bigger the denominator the smaller the pieceshe didnt write the right denominatorhe should next time use the shadedpeices as the numeratorhe put the wrong denominatiorhe didnt mutiply the correct wayan equivalent fraction has to be equelshe idnt multiply righthe multiplied wronglolsdsshe is wrong20lolhi willyou cant subtract them because they dont have tthe same denominatorthe smaller the denominator the bigger the pieceI think she did show 7,9-3,4=4,5.7-3=4 and 9-4=5.15,21 is larger than 15,24 because 21 is less than 24.If I had a cake  and I cut a piece that was 15,21cm. and a piece that was 15,24cm. I would want the piece that is 15,21 because it is bigger.he needs to see how many times a number go into the fractionAlison needs to know her  multiplacation facts.she needs to know each change is different.They wont always be the same.He needs to check his work after he is done with that problem.she needs to know her multiple facts.Kaitie nees to know what she is doing in her math problems.Ryan needs to know his facts.matt needs to check over his work.Brad needs tl know his repeated addition facts.Effie needs to know her multiplecation fact that are farther that 10.Sally needs to know her multiplecation facts.He needs to know what a least common denomonator is.He needs to check his work when he is done.he needs to chech his workShe needs to pay more attention in math class.leslie needs to know her multiplecation facts.I think she showed the problem well.She did all of the math right and showed the pictures in the right way too.323232,65 is smaller than 32,45 because 45 is less than 65.they have to equilit hasto equil the sameit has to be equilhithey are all evenboth numbers have to multiplyermultiplymulti plymultiplymultiplymultiply by 3multiply by 8 in the first one and 5 in the second onehe subtracted the dinominators.0.1                      28-27 = 1.1                           28-27=1beacause it has more of somethingI think that Kia is wrong.I think that Kia is wrong.  You have to convert 7/9 to 28/36 and 3/4 to 27/36. When you subtract them you\\'re answer is 1/36.15/21 is larger than 15/24 because 24 is bigger than 21. If you break down a whole into 24 equal parts each part is gng to ge smaller and smaller each time the denomonator gets larger. So 21 has bigger parts than 24.Only use division or multipication or divcision, dont use both.Make sure that it is the smallest number instead of one in the middle.  Also make sure the denomonators are the same.Multiply by the same or different numbers to get one denominator.Multiply the denomonators by the smallest number possibleMulity both numbers by the smallest denominator possible to get the least common denominator.Mulity the two numbers by the same number to get a commojn denominator.Multiply the denominatorts by the smallest number possible to get a least common denominator.Mulitply the same numbers in the denominators for the leats common denominator.Multiply the denominators by the smallest numbers possible to get the least common denominatior.To figure out if the fractions are <,>, or = convert the fractions to have the same denominator and then judge from the numerator.make the fractions the same and find out what the lcd isfind the least comm0on denominatorfind thye lcdfind the lcdMake sure you are multipling by the same number for the numorator.find t6he lcdfind the lcdKia is wrong. If you convert the fractions you would get 10/40+ 32/40. When you would add those together you would get 42/40 witch is an improper fraction.  Even if you simplified it, it would not give you 6/13.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 is because 65 is bigger than 45.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 is because 65 is bigger than 45.  All 65 parts have to be equal, so each part has to be really small. But, in 45 there is less equal parts so each part could be a little bit bigger.  So the numorater could fill in more of the whole in 45 than in 65.it is incorrect because you do not add the numerators together and the denominators together to get an answer.it is smaller because the bigger the denominator is the smaller the size is.He needs to multiply 9 by 2 and 6 by 2 to find the correct answer.Multiply 7 by 2 instead of 3 and leave 5 the same.She should multiply instead of dive the 2 by 2.Multiply by 2 instead of add 3Multiply by 2 instead of adding 2.denominator should be the loest number 6 and 10 could go intoShe should of found the largest number both numbers can fit intoshe should find the loesfind the lowest nuber both can fit infind the lowest number both can fit intofind the smallest nimber that they both fit intofind the smallest nimber that they both fit intofind the smallest number that goes into both numbersfind the smallest number that goes into boththe smaller the denominator is the bigger the value is depending on the numeratorinstead of adding he should multiply the numeratorshe should find the smallest multiple of both denominatorsdont add the numeratorthe smaller numewrator wiill always be larger if the  numerators are the samea lcd is the smallest multipleboth denominatorsmultiply instead of add the numeratorthe correct steps to the problem are: 1) 6 x 5 = 30,      2) 10 x ? = 30, 3) 10 x 3=30!She needs to do 21x1 and see what that gives her. Then she needs to do 3x? to get 21. So, she would need to do 3x7=21.she needs to do 12x2 to see what that gives her. she should have gotten 24. now, she needs to see what 8x? gives her 24. which she should have gotten 3x8= 24he has to do 5x2. then he has to do see what that gives him. he should have gotten 10. now, he has to see how to get 10 from 10x?. he should have done 10x1.he needs to do 6x2 to see what that gives him. then after he got 12 from 6x2, he needs to see what 4x? gets him to 12. he should have done 4x3.he needs to do 8x2 to get 16. then, he needs to see 16x? gives you 16. he should hav done 16x1.she needs to do 15x3 to get 45. then she needs to do 9x? she should get 5.she needs to 4x6 to get 24. then she needs to do 24x? to get 24. she should have done 24x1.he needs to do every thing that he did exept use this sign (<) rather than this sign(>).he needs to every thing that he did exept he needs to use this sign[<] rather than this sign[>].he needs to do every thing the same exept the 18 to a 12. then change the 17 to a 5.she has to multiply the 7 & 8 by 1. then she needs to multiply the 2 & 1 by 4.she is wrong because you can not add the two bottom numbers together she should have added the top two numbers and at the bottom she should have changed the 5 into an 8.it is smaller because if you did percentages you would see that the percentage of 32/65 is smaller than 32/45 said you can\\'t subtract the number on the bottom.It is larger because 15 is closer to 21 then 15 is to 24.  If you count to the number 21 you will get to it first and get to 24 last.  So that is why it is larger.He needs to know the multiplacation problems for the numbers he is working with.That will help him with the problem.Alison needs to check her work when she is finished.

I think that because she is adding the denoator and you can never add the denoator but, her picture is very helpful for peaple to udersand. Her answer is not comptly wrong. 2+4 is 6 so that part is right.It is smaller because 32 is coser to 45 then 32 is to 45.she is wrong because she just added the denomnators when she had to find the a common denomnators.the second one is bigger because smaler the denomnator bigger the fraction and since the have the same numorator it is bigger.He needs to multiply the numerator and the denominatorShe needs to multiply the numerator and the denominator both by 2.she needs to multiply the numerator and the denominator both by 2.she needs to multiply insted of addtionhe needs to multiply insted of addingyou have to mulitply the numerator and the denominator by the same number.you need to multiply insted of addingyou need to multiply by the same number for the numerator and the denominator.He needs to find the LCD.She needs to find the LCDShe needs to find the LCD.he needs to find the LCDHe needs to find the LCD.He needs to find the LCD.She needs to find the LCD.She needs to make the LCD.He needs to find the least common denomantor.He needs to find the correct numeratorThe denominator has to be the same for both.She needs to multiply the numerators insted of adding them.The bigger fraction has the bigger numerator.The LCD is the same for both fractions.She needs to multiply the numerator insted of adding it.She needs to compare then rightshe needs to find the least comon denominator for the two fractions.the denominator is bigger witch makes it bigger.No because first you need common denominators for all of the numbers so you can add them easier.If you reduce them 32/65 is smaller than 32/45just add the number againet it rightoley senurita you need to multiply by 2 to get your awnser.just double itTry to find a multiple that both numbers go into.Olivia needs to put the largest number into both denominatorsFind the product of both denominatorsfind the product of both deniominatorshe didnt try at allyou just need to multiply better.you need to know when to not multiply a number that should stay the same.always multiply the numirnator by the other denominatoryou didnt put the right smybol for the greater than or less than it was suposed to be less thanyou need to find the smallest denominator not the second biggest onethe denominators where correct but no the nuorators.you need to multipluy betterNo because you need to find the least common denominator.because there is a smaler denominator.No, she is wronge because you only add the numerators and not the denominators. She also added with uncommon denominators when you have to have common denominators. The real answr is 1 2/40.You need to find 2 diffrent numbers that will make each denominator match.You should find out if your smaller denominator can go into your bigger denominator and find out out to get it to the same number.Katiie, you should find the least commen denominator posible instead of just multiplying the denominators together.Ryan, you should find the least common denominator by seeing if your smaller denominator can go into your bigger denominator. If it does then you have to figure how many times it goes into it.You need to learn your math.You have to learn your multiplication facts.You need to use a least commen denominator.YOU NEED TO LEARN YOUR MATH, Dummy!!You needed to find the least commen denominator.You needed to find the least commen denominator.You need to find the least common denominator.You needed to find the least commen denominator.I don\\'t think that she is right because, she subtracted the numerators and the denominators.

Also she subtracted the denomators, in which you really dont change them15/21 is bigger because the demonator is smaller. When the demonator is smaller it is closer to the number, such as 21he needs to know to use the same operation on the numerator and denomatorYou have to multipy by the same numberyou have to double the numberhe should pick something that divides into the demonator evenlyshe should not multipy by a number that will make it hugeshe needed to find a smaller numberHe needs to find a smaller numberhe needs to  mltiply correctlyhe needs to find a smaller multipleHe cant judge a fractions by the denomatorhe needs to know the bigger numerator is bigger when the denomators are the sameshe needs to look for the least commen denomatorshe needs to look for the least common denominatorshe needs to covert correctlyHe needs to find a least commen demonatorShe needs to find a commen demonator for bothshe needs to multpily correctlyhe needs to know which fraction is greaterthat is incorrect. she needs to change the fraction so both denomaters are the same, otherwise you wil have to add the denomaters like they did in the problem, which makes the anwser really wrong.32/65 is smaller because it is farther away from the whole number, however 32/45 is close to the whole number/ demonater.it is wrong. the fractions have to be equal to add them.the denominator is smallershe didnt write the right denominatorhe should next time use the shadedpeices as the numeratorhe put the wrong denominatiorhe didnt mutiply the correct wayan equivalent fraction has to be equelshe idnt multiply righthe multiplied wronglolsdsshe is wrong20lolhi willwrong.when you subtract fractions you don\\'t change the denominatorsthe smaller the denominator the bigger the fractionyes because 7/9-3/4 does equal 4/5.15/21 is larger because the denominators are different. 15/24 is smaller because it has more.multiply by 2 to the numerator and denominatormultiply by the same numberdo not add one and subtract the otherdo not add numbers together you have to use a multiplelook carefully at your multiplyinglook carefully at your multiplyingwhat your addingwhat your multiplyingdo not subtractdo not dividewatch the multipleswatch your multiplesgreater looking fraction is not always greaterdo not addwatch your multiplesdo not addtake your timewatch your multiplestake your timethis is right32/65 is smaller because the denominators are smallerI think it is not right because 2 of the 3/4\\'th\\'s don\\'t go into all of the 7/9\\'th\\'sI think it is because the denominator in 15/21\\'th\\'s is smaller than the one in15/24\\'th\\'sI think that she showed the right answer because her models show the right answerBecause it has a smaller denomenator so it maks it a bigger fraction than the other onefind multiple ways to simplify itfind multiple ways to simplify ittry your bestif you dont understand ask for helptry your bestthe lower the denomonater and if the numerators are the same it is greaterjust multiply by the denominatortry your besti think the is right because the models show the right amounti think the is right because the models show the right amountbecause the denominater is smaller than the other one so it makes it biggeri agree because it equiles that fractionthe first fraction is biggerThere is no 27 th in the fractions.She can get the problem right by getting the fraction.He needs to multiply correctly.She just needed to swich 7 and 196 is the wrong number she should put 24.he needs to not give the least common a bigger number.He thought that 5/9 was less than 5/8Jimmy mutipiled incorretly it is 12/20 and 5/20she needs to do the faction rightshe needs to get the fraction rightit is wrongit is rightdo not count the unshaded peicesdo not count the unshaded partsmake sure the denomanator is bigger than the numaratormake sure the change is the samedo not  make the numarator smaller than the denomanatoryou cant put the faction incheck before you say its wrongall the denomonators need to be the same or equivelentthe larger the denomonator the smaller the fractionI do not think thst she cannot do that because the fractions need the same denominator. She did it right on the numerator but she didn`t do it on the denominator.15/21 is bigger than 15/24 because the higher the denomerator the smaller the fraction.For example, pretend that both the fractions are fraction circles. Because 15/24 is cut up into more pieces than 15/21  the pieces in 15/24 is smaller than the 15/21.First you need to erase the 2 shaded pieces. Then put five shaded pieces into five squares. There! Now your done making five pieces shaded in. The fraction will look like this 5/7.First you need take away 2.Then you need to take away the 27. After you take away the numerator and the denominator you need to do 6*2= 12. I did this because it says to make an equivelent fraction where the numerator is double. Then do 9*2=18.Put 12 as tYou have to make something like a line plot or fraction circle. You have to do this with both of the fractions. Compare then to each other.

Second of all youm need to NOT add both of the denominarors together. Other than that you are good.Because I like lollypops and lots and lots of candy. I also like god and my mum and dad.I think her answer is wrong because when I solved the  problem, I got 1/36.15/21 is larger because 21 is smaller than 24, so 15 goes into 21 closer.he needs to find the least common denominator. and not find the smallest number that goes into both denominators.She needs to not divide and find the least common denominator.She needs to not find the largest number that goes into both denominators.ryan needs to find what 10 and 5 can both go into without having a big number.He needs to not divide to get the least common denominators.Lester needs to know what fraction is bigger. 40 / 72      45/72He needs to multiply and not add the numerator.Kima needs to not divide and multiply.She needs to multiply the fractions correctly.He thought that 28/35 was greater than 20/35, and he needs to know which fraction is bigger.He thought that 28/35 was greater than 20/35, and he needs to know which fraction is bigger.She needs to not divide the fraction and multiply.She needs to multiply, not add.Omar needs to know witch fraction is greater.I think she is wrong because when I solved the problem, I got 1 and 1/20.32/65 is smaller because it is clser to 1/2 and 32/45 is closer to 2/3, and 1/2 is smaller than 2/3.?bigger the denominatior the more peices there areyou need t double by multiplying 2always when it says double multiply 210 is 30 6 times 5 is 30read carefully ad check your workCheck your workYOU DID ITCHANGE YOUR ANSWER AND CHECK YOUR WORcheck your work and becarefulbecareful check your workCheck your workBECAREFUL CHECK YOUR WORKcheck your workCHECK your work?The smaller the dinominator the less peciesI think Kia is wrong because she needs to find the common denominator not just subtract the denominator and the numerator15/21 is larger than 15/24 because the denominator is smaller in 15/24To make the new fraction, use the same operationto make the new fraction, use the oprtionFor the next fraction change use the same operationUse the same oporations next timeuse the same operationsuse the same operationuse the same operationuse the same operationMultilply correctlyPick the right sign next timemutiple rightFind the lcd rightmutiple rigytPut the right signmutiple rightMultiply rightPut the correct signIt the wrong because you don\\'t add the denominator.Because 65 is greater than 45I think she is wrong because the fractions have different denomonators and you dont add the denomonatorsbecause i dont knowFirst you do 6*2=12 then you do 9*2=18 then 18 +12=22First you do 5*2=10 then you do 7*2=14 then do 14+10=24First you do 2*2=4 then you do 8*2=16 then you do 16+4=20chek your answer and your spellingcheck your work before giving it to your teachermake shore you no how to do mathask the teacher if you need helpI think that Kia is rong because you have to find  the common denomonator and you dont add the denomonatorsbecause 21 is smaller than 24 and 21 is closer to 15 than 24 isKia isKia isKia is correct because 7/9 is bigger than 3/4 and 4/5 is bigger than 3/4. So, 7 - 3 = 4 and 9 - 4 = 5. So, the is 4/5 and Kia is correct.15/21 is larger than 15/24 because 15/21 has a smaller denominator.To make your answer correct, you have to double the numerater, 6 , and double the denominator, 9 , to find 12/18. 9 multiplied by 2 equals 18, which would be the denominator and 6 multiplied by 2 equals 12 would be the numerater.                                                     Correct Answer: 12/18To make the answer correct you have to double the numerator, 5 , and double the denominator, 7. 5 multiplied by 2 equals 10 which would be the numorator and 7 multiplied by 2 equals 14.  Correct Answer: 10/14To have the correct answer you need to multiply the denominator, 6, by 5 which equals 30 and multiply the denominator, 10, by 3 which equals 30.To have the correct answer you need to multiply the denominator, 21, by 1 which equals 21 and multiply the denominator, 3, by 7 which equals 21. So, the least common denominator is 21.To make the answer correct you need to multiply the denominator, 21 , by one to find 21 and multiply the other denominator, 3 , by 7 to find 21 as the correct answer.To have the correct answer you need to multiply the denominator , 12 , by 2 to find 24 and multiply the other denominator , 8, by 3 to find the correct answer of 24.To make the answer correct you need to multiply the denominator, 5, by 2 to find 10 and multiply the other denominator, 10, by 1 to find the correct answer of 10.To have the correct answer you need to multiply the denominator, 6 , by 2 which equals 12 and then multiply the other denominator, 4 , by 3 which equals 12. So, the least common denominator is 12.To make the answer correct you need to multiply the denominator, 6, by 2 to find 12 and multiply the other denominator, 4, by 3 to find the correct answer of 12.Kia is wrong because in her picture 2/8 and 4/5 are bigger than 6/13.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because it has a bigger denominator.When you are adding fractions you have to find the least common denominator between the fractions and then you add the numerators. The correct answer simplified would be 1/832/65 is smaller than 32/45 beause the denominator is a larger number in 32/65. The numerator is the same number but the denominators are different which makes 32/65 larger than 32/45When you are converting fracions you should always multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number.When you are converting fractions you should always multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same numberypu need to get your fractions rightwhen you are converting fractions you should always multiply the numerator and denominator by the same numberwhen converting fractions you should always multiply and multiply by the same number for both the numerator and denominatorwhen converting fractions you always multiply the numerator and denominator by the same numberwhen converting fractions you always mutiply and when you do that you should always multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same numberwhen converting fractions you should always multiply the numerator and denominator by the same numberWhen finding the LCD you must find the smallest number that goes into both denominatorsIf one denominator goews into the other one that means the fraction stays the same but the other one is changedYou never multiply the denominators together in any situation its always finding the LCDif one denominator goes into the other, leave that one like that but change the other onewhen finding the smallest number that goes into both denominators the number has to be largerthan both of them but it has to be a multiple of that numberif one denominator goes into the other one leave thst one alone but change the other oneThe LCD is the smallest multuiple of two denominators. you have to keep multiplying until you find a multiple that goes into both denominatorsif one denominator goes into the other one, change it to that number if it\\'s a factor of that numberthe fraction with the smallest denominator is the larger fractionif u multiply the denominator by onr number than you must multiply the numerator by the same numberif the one denominator is a factor of the other one, leave that one the same and change the other one to have the same denominatorif you multiply one denominator by one number than you have to multiply the other one by the same numberthe fraction with the smaller denominator is the larger fractionif you multiply one denominator by a number than you must multiply the other denominator by the same numberif you multiply one denominator by a number you must multiply the other denominator by the same numberthe fraction with the smaller denominator is the larger fractionI think Kia subtracted wrong. When you subtract fractions you don\\'t subtract across, you have to find an LCD and then subtract15/21 is larger than 15/24 because 15/21 has a smaller denominatorKia just added the numarators and the demonanators together to get her answer. But because the demonanators were diferent she needs to find a common denomanator to add because then the peices will be equal. The real answer is 36/40.The denomanator in 32/65 is bigger than the denomantor in 32/45 so because they have the same amont of peices and different size peices the one with the smaller denomanator is bigger, which in this case is 32/45.Robert needs to double the numerator and the denomantor when he is finding a double fration. If he he had 6/9 he would the numerator and the denomantor to find his answer!Alison needs to multiply the numerator and denominator by 2 to get the double fraction which is her answer.When Vanessa double the denominator on her number line answer, but she divided by two on her numerator number. She would need to multiply both.Raj added three to each instead of multiplying by two.Jamal added 2 to each instead of multipling by 2.Jamal added 2 to each instead of multipling by 2.Alexander should try to multiply the denominators by one number that will give hime the same product. If it is the smallest number they both go into that will be the least commom denominator.Olivia should try to find the smallest number they both go into. If she does this, she will have found her least common denominators.Kaitie needs to use the smallest least common denominator not the biggest. :)Ryan multiplied both denominators together to get a big common denominators instead of the smallest.He should have put 6 x 2 =  12  = 3 x 4Brad should have got the least common denomanator 16 by multipling 8 by 2 and 16 by 1.Effie should have put 15 x 3 = 45 = 5 x 9Lester had to multiply the numerator by what he multiplied the denominator.Jimmy had to multiply what he had multiplied for the denominator.Kima did not use the same denominator. Instead she used two different ones.Leslie multiplied the denominator differently from her numerator.D\\'Angelo should have looked at the numorator when they had the same denominator instead of the original denominator.Anne had to make the same denominator, but instead didn\\'t.I think that is incorrect because you never ever change the denominater. Even if there is different denominaters younever ever change it.15/21 is larger than 15/24 because 15 is closer to 21.Robert here is some advice to solve the problem.   First, you want to do six and double that. Than do nine and double that and you will get the answer.Alison here is some advice. First, do five and double that.

Then do 5 times 9and keep the 72.Jimmy here is some advice. 3 times 4 and do 5 times 4. Then do 1 times 5 and do 4 times 5.Kima here is some advice. First do 7 times 1 then do 8 times 1 then 1 times 4 then 2 times4Leslie here is some advice. Do 1 times 3 and 4 times 3. Then do 2 times 4 and 3 times.Do 4 times 5 and 7 times 5. Then do 4 times 4 and 5 times 73 =6 9=18 4=12 6=183=9 6=12 3=9 4=122=16 5=40 2=10 8=40Kia you are right about the 2 plus 4 equels 6 but dont ever add the denominater. Do the biggest number.32/65 is smaller than 36/45 because 32 is closer to the number 45he needs to think about all the multiples of both numbers and see if any are the samethink if one of the numbers can go into the other then keep going from therethink of the numbes that both numbers can go intothink about the multiples both numbers havethink about all the multiples of both numbersthink about all the multiples for both numbersthink about the multiples of both numbersthink about all the multiples of both numbersThink about all the multiples of both numbersthink of the multiples for both numbersthink about the multiples for both numbersthink about the multiples for both numbersthink about the multiples for both numbersthink about all the multiples for both numbersthink about the multiples for both numbersthink about all the multiples for both numbersshe added them wronge. You have to change the denominator to the lcd.65 is a bigger number than 45 is so 32 doesnt take as much of 65 as it would for 45.She is wrong because she added the denominators. You go with the biggest denominator the awnser really is 6/8Alexander needs to know his multiplacation facts, he also needs to know the smallest number that goes into to bothe denominators is the least common denominator.Olivia needs to know what the least common denominator is. She can do that by knowing her facts and multiples.Katie needs to know her multiplacation facts and the common denominators for fractions.Lester didnt multiply right. He should work on his facts.Jimmy didnt multiply right.Kima did not multiply right.Leslie didnt multiply right.D\\'Angelo needs to know that the larger denominator is the larger fraction.Anne needs to know the least common denominators for fractions.Donna needs to know the least common denominators of fractions.Omar needs to know that the fraction with larger denominator is the larger fraction.She is correct because 2She is correct because 2 + 4 = 6 and 8 + 5 = 13, so if you add 2/8 + 4/5 you get 6/13.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because 65 is a bigger denominator so it would take up alot more space than 45, and 32 is about half of 65 when it is almost three fourths of 45 so therefore thirty-two fourty-fifths is bigger than thirty -two sixty-fifths.Instead of 5 times nine you should have done 5 time 8.You need to multiply the denominator and numerator to compare the fractions.First make somthing equal to 1 half that 8 can be or go into 8  then since 8 can go into 8 keep that the sameFirst make the denomators equal then multply the numtars same amount of times as the denomator to get your answerShe is WRONG because all of these fractions are equal and if you subtract one from the other you will get zero for example 7/9 - 3/4 = 0/0The denominator is bigger in the smaller number.You need to remember your math facts and try to study hardAlison has to remember her math facts to get the answer.Kia is wrong. She is wrong because she only subtracted the numeraters. Kia should have simplified the denominators then subtracted the numeraters.15/21 is greater than 15/24 because if you simplify them,you can see the deference.He could have simplified the fraction to make it eaiser for him to find the numerator and denimonator.Alexander needs to find the least possible multiples of both numbers.Olivia needs to multiple intead of divide when finding the least common deniominator because fractions are related to division.Katie needs to find the least common deniominator instead of finding the product of both numbers.Ryan found the product of both deniominators instead of the least common deniominator.Matt multiplied the numerator times the opppisite deniominator instead of finding the least common deniominator and needed to multipliy each denimonator by another factor to get the same exact multiple.Lester needs to compare  the fractions not the deniominators.JimmyKima needed to multiply the 2 by 4 and the 8 by 1 to give her 4/8 and 7/8.nbhnhshes wrong because when u do 2/8 plus 4/5 u get 1 1/20.cause they denominator is bigger then the other one so the number gets smaller when the denominator gets bigger.u need to slow down and do ur work rightu need to slooooowww downyou need to slow downslow downslow downslow downslow downslow downslow downskow dowmslow downslow downslow downslow downslow downslow downslow downslow downslow downslow down fam:>>slow downslow downslow downslow downhe is rightbecuase the bigger the denominator is the smaller the answer isKia did the question wrong. To correctly answer the problem you have to find a common denomonator. She just added them without finding it, so therefore she is wrong. The correct answer is 3/4.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because sixty five is bigger than fourty five. When the denomonater is  bigger it will take a bigger numerator to even out.Robert needs to multiply each number by to(the numerator and denomonater).Alison needs to multiply both numbers(the numerator and denomonater) by two.Vanessa needs to multiply the numerator and denomanator by two.Raj needs to multiply not add.Jamal needs to multiply not add.Victor needs to multiply by two.Mary needs to multiply by two.Otis needs to multiply by two.Alexander needs to multiply by the correct numbers to get the right answer.Olivia needs to multiply by the correct numbers to get the right answer.Kaitie needs to multiply by the correct numbers to get the right answer.Ryan needs to multiply by the correct numbers to get the right answer.Matt needs to multiply by the correct numbers to get the right answer.Brad needs to multiply by the correct numbers to get the right answer.Effie needs to multiply by the correct number to get the right answer.Sally needs to mutiply by the correct numbers to get the right answer.Lester should remember if the denominator is larger the number is usually smaller.Jimmy needs to multiply by the right numbers.Kima needs to reduce not add.Leslie needs to multiply by the right numbers.D\\'Angelo needs to remember the smaller the denominator the smaller the fraction usually.Anne needs to multiply by the right numbers.Donna needs to multiply by the right numbers.Omar needs to remember the smaller the denominator the smaller the fraction usually.Kia did the problem wrong. She was supposed to find a common denominator then subtract.It is because if you find the common denominator 15/21 is larger.I think that was a good start to explaining the prosses to the problem. If I did this problem I would have explained more about my steps.I think that was a good start to explaining the prosses to the problem. If I did this problem I would have explained more about my steps.The reason it is smaller is because 65 hundredths are smaller than 45 hundredths because 45 has more to it\\'s whole but 65 whole is smaller.Jordan should have counted the pieces that were shaded instead she counted the numbers that were not shadedRobert divided  6 / 3 =2 ,but he multiplied 9*3=27. So he needs make an equivelent fraction by multipling by 2Alison muliplied 5 by 2=10 but she muliplied 7 by 3 = 21she divided 2 by 2 =1 instead of she sould have muliplied by 2lester made 1 mistake the mistake was that he put the > instead of <.What I think is that she corret. I know that 7 nineths - 3 fourths = 4 fifths.it larger because it is is correct is correct15 21she should look at the fractions that are shaded then she should count the shaded fractions and get 2 as the numerator and get 7 as the  denomintorwe multiplyed by 2 because, the fraction circie to the right was cut up into 27 and 2 were shaded so, we multiplyed the numerator and denominator by 2I muiltiply by 2 because they are ready muiltyply by 2 in 5 times 2 so idid the same thing on the denominatori knew that the denominator is muiltiply by 2 so did it to the numinator it is 2 times 2 =4every answer was correct but her greater and less symol was wrong. She said that the the fraction on the bottom was less but she was wrong it was greater thanjimmyI think Kia is wrong because, you can not add different denominators, not even if they are the same.It is smaller because, the fractions are cut up into tinyerIt is smaller because, the fractions are cut up into tinyer piecesthat is wrong because he added the denominators, but he has to find the least common denominator.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because 65 is bigger than 45 and it takes longer for 32 to get to 65 than it does to get to 45He has to multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2to find least common denominator you need to find the smallest number that goes into both denominatorsto find least common denominator you have to find the smallest number that goes into both of the fractions when you multiply to find the least common denominator.When finding least common denominator you cant multiply both denomiators together you have to find a number that both deminators go into  equally and it has to be the same number that both go into.when finding the largest fraction you cant compare the denominators and just think if the denominater is greater the fraction is greater. You havwhen finding lcd you have to multiply the numerator by the same number that you multiplied for the denominatorwhen finding lcd you have to find the smallest number that goes into both denominatrs equally and it cant be less than any of the denominators.that is not correct because you first have to fnd the least common denominatorthat is not correct because you first have to fnd the least common denominator (lcd) then you have to subtract the numerator but not the denominator to find the answer15/21 is larger than 15/24 because the denominator of 21 is larger than the denominator of 24. Also, 15 is closer to 21 than 24the answer is 42/40 because you have to make the denominators the same. 8 and 5 both go into 40. you make the denominators 40. 8 can go into 40 5 times, you have to make your numerator 10 because 2 times 5. you change 4/ 5 into 32 / 40. then add your to new fractions.because 32 is closer to 45 than 65.he needs to find the least common denominator. and not find the smallest number that goes into both denominators.She needs to not divide and find the least common denominator.She needs to not find the largest number that goes into both denominators.ryan needs to find what 10 and 5 can both go into without having a big number.He needs to not divide to get the least common denominators.Lester needs to know what fraction is bigger. 40 / 72      45/72He needs to multiply and not add the numerator.Kima needs to not divide and multiply.She needs to multiply the fractions correctly.He thought that 28/35 was greater than 20/35, and he needs to know which fraction is bigger.He thought that 28/35 was greater than 20/35, and he needs to know which fraction is bigger.She needs to not divide the fraction and multiply.She needs to multiply, not add.Omar needs to know witch fraction is greater.I think the answer is 1 /36 because if you make an equal fraction the both deniminators can go into, the deniminator then you multiply the numerators then get 28 for one numerator and 27 for the other then subtractBecause 15 is closer to 21 than 24L think that Kia is wrong because if you cheI think that Kia is wrongI thnk that kia is wrong because if you check subtraction by using addition 4/5 + 3/4 you get 1 11/20.  So this Shows that Kia is wrong.15/21 is greater than 15/ 24 because if yoou cross multiply 15/21 is 360 and 15/24 is 315 and 360 is greater than 315 so 15/24 is greater than 15/24.robert needs to muliply or dividemake sure the least common denomenator is the same.kobeshe needs to mulplyfind the largest #mulymulplyfind lcdfind icdcurryKia is wrong because she did not find the LCD.  For addition you must find LCD.Because if you see that the numurators are the same and the denomurators are different the fraction with the smaller number is greater.yes because the denominators 4 plus 5 and 3 plus 4 equils 7 over 9the denominator is less so that makes the number worth morebe more careful when you do problems and double check after you finnish and read the directionsmake sure to be careful when you multiply and use your fractions for the correct answerthe lesser the denomantor the greater the answer isthe lesser the denomanator the greater the amsweryou need to study more and look carefully at the questionsbe more carefull when you do your playgroundno because she just added the numbers aand you have to have the denanators and she just added themthe more the denomanator the less the ansewr because the numarator only goes in to the answer more so that would make it smallerYou do not do anything to the denominator.15 21ths is larger than 15 24ths because 15 is closer to 21 than 24multiplie the numerator by 2 and same thing for the denominator.multiplie tke numerator and the denominator by 2multiplie the denominator and numerator by 2.multiplie by 2.kn ow your multiplication tables to make 30do times 112x2 equals 24 3x8 24use your 2 and 1 tables2 and 3 tablesyou used additionjust do mathsimple math5 is closer to 8 than 9do x4practicex4 for 23rdslots of practicex2 and 3practicepracticeyou dont add the denominator32 is closer to 45 than 65It\\'s incorrect because she forgot to get both of the fractions a common demoninater and she added the numeraters when she wasn\\'t supposed to.When you cut down the factions to make them smaller, 32/45 is stil larger than 32/65.do the multiplacation until you get the 2 same answers and  that should become denominatortry and take the larger number and divide it by the other number then mulipy the second fraction by your answerif you need to just multiply the two denominators to find a common onemultipy the two numbers till you get the same answerMultiply the numbers till you get the same answer.just multiply teh numbers till you get the same answerif you have the same denominater the larger numerator will make that fraction greatermake sure you multiply the fraction parts by the same numberjust do the multiplacationfind a fraction that is equal to the origanal fractionmake sure the 2 fractions have the same denimantorsNo because she\\'s not supposed to take away or add to the numerators but she took 3 away from 7.When you simplify 15/21 it becomes 5/7 and when you simplify 15/24 it becomes 5/8 so 15/21 is still bigger.just add the number againet it rightoley senurita you need to multiply by 2 to get your awnser.just double itTry to find a multiple that both numbers go into.Olivia needs to put the largest number into both denominatorsFind the product of both denominatorsfind the product of both deniominatorshe didnt try at allyou just need to multiply better.you need to know when to not multiply a number that should stay the same.always multiply the numirnator by the other denominatoryou didnt put the right smybol for the greater than or less than it was suposed to be less thanyou need to find the smallest denominator not the second biggest onethe denominators where correct but no the nuorators.you need to multipluy betterno because you cant add 8 and 5 without finding the least common factor between them.its smaller becuase greater the number smaller it is.I think she is wrong because 7/9-3I think she is wrong because 7/9-3/4=1/36it is larger because 21 is smaller and will have bigger parts so it will be largerkeeep adding dodnominators until you get the same number and you could multiply the two donominators togetherjust keep ading the donominators together until you get the same nummberAlways try to find the LCD don\\'t just multiply the denominators together.try to find the LCD and dont just randomly multiplty.do not just multiply numbers because you will get a random LCDLester should not think that the bigger the number the bigger the fractionFor the numerator he can not just add random numbersTry to find the LCD not just any common denominatordont put random stuff for the numerator ;

The first thing I would do is mutiply both numbers by two first then if yu want to go higher in mutiples....go higher.Just go threw the multiples of both numbers and put the multiples next to each other so when the numbers are the same you\\'ll figure that out easily.Just like I told someone else  t hat got a problem wrong like this put each numbers mulitples beside each other until you hit x 9. Then if you don\\'t find a number thats the same in each row then keep going til you hit x18 then if you can\\'t find a number that\\'s the same check all your work and if you think all your tomes work is right keep going to x100 and if you can;t find it then ask the teacher what your doing wrong and let them help you.Like I told two other people that got a promblem wrong like this put both numbers multiples next to each other up til x9 then if no number maches at all keep going until xq18 the if you don\\'t find a number maching then go back and check your work. If you think all your times work is fine then keep going  until x100 and then i you don\\'t find it then ask your teacher what your doing wrong and see if him/her could help you with the problem.Like I told three different kids that got a problem wrong like this problem just put both numbers multiples next to each other and start multipling. Stop when you hit x9 see if any multiple nmber match up and if they don\\'t start multipling again until you hit x18 then stop and see if you made any multipling mistakes and if you think your times work is fine then go up to x100 then if you don\\'t find any numbers that match then ask your teacher what your dong wrong ans also ask if he/her could help you with the problem.Like I told 4 other children that got a problem wrong like this just put both multiples of both number side by side and go up until x9 then if no numbers match and if they don\\'t then go up til yu hit x18 then go back and see if any  umbers match. If no numbers match check your work and if  you think all of your work is right then you til x100 then if you see no numbers that match then ask your teacher what your doing wrong then ask him/her to help you with the problem.Dear Lester, When you do a problem like this just times the denominator\\'s by each other and then the answer is the denominator. After that just times the numinator by the other number. Like the question that you did 9x8=72 then the five that\\'s over the nine will be times by eight and the five over the eight will be times by nine.Dear Jimmy, When you do a problem like this just times both denominator\\'s by each other. Like thisproblem would be 5x4=20 so, the denimator is 20. And then the 3 that\\'s over the five will be 3x4 and the 1 over the four will be 1x5.The demionator does not get plused the deminators(if there the same) will stay that number.If the demnonators aren\\'t the same you times them until the they match up but the numerator wil be added so the answer would be: 2 over 40(2 over eight)+ 4 over 40+ 6 over 40. I times the 8 in 2 over 8 by 5 to get 40 and the 5 in 4 over 5 by 8 to get 40.Because, the 32 in 32 over 45 is closer to 45 is than 32 is to 65.Multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number to get an equivalent fraction.To make an equivalent fraction where the numerator is double, multiply the numerator and the denominator by two.To make an equivalent fraction where the numerator is double, multiply the numerator and the denominator by two.When making an equivalent fraction where the numerator is double, multiply the numerator and denominator by twoWhen finding the LCD for fractions, multiply the denominators by the SAME number.When finding a LCD for fractions, multiply the denominators by the same number.Remember to multiply the denominator by the same number when finding the LCD for fractions.When finding an LCD for fractions, remember to multiply the denominator by the same number.When finding an LCD for fractions, remember to multiply the denominator by the same number.When finding an LCD for fractions, remember to multiply the denominator by the same number.When finding an LCD for fractions, remember to multiply the denominator by the same number.When finding the LCD for fractions, multiply the denominator by the same numberRemember to multiply the denominators by the same number when finding the LCD for fractions.The fraction with the smaller denominator but the same numerator is largerThe fraction with the same denominator but the larger numerator is biggerThe fraction with the larger numerator but the same denominator is largerThe fraction wit the bigger numerator but the same denominator is largerThe fraction with the same numerator but the smaller denominator is biggerThe fraction with the same denominator but the bigger numerator is largerThe fraction with the same denominator but a larger numerator is biggerThe fraction with the same denominator but a bigger numerator is largerI think have also added another picture using common denominators so it is easier to see if she is correct or not.It is bigger because fractions with the same numerator but smaller denominators are bigger. Also it is bigger because 15 is closer to 21 than 24.No she is wrong. She just added the numeratorsIt is larger because the smaller the denomorator the bigger the fraction.Dear Robert, You need to double your numerator  and denominatoryou should have made each problem equal to 30Dear Olivia, you should have made the answers equal .Do not multiply all the numbersDear Lester, the smaller denominator is the larger fraction .you ssssssshould haveShe is wrong.She just added the numerators and the denomenators together.Because it has a larger numerator.I think kia should have found the comon denominaters first, instead of just adding them.32/65 is smaler than 32/45 because 32/65 is smaller away to the denominater.32/45 is closer to the denominater , so it is a bigger fraction.The correct steps for solving this problem are to do 10 times 3 and 6 times 5 to get 30the correct steps for this problem are to do 7 times 3 and 21 times 1 to get 21the correct steps for sovling this problem are to do 8 times 3 and 12 times 2 to get 24the correct steps for this problem are to do 10 times 1 and 5 times 2 to get 10To get the correct answer matt needs to do 6 times 2 and 4 times 3To get the correct answer Brad needs to do 1 times 16 and 8 times 2To get the answer correct you need to do 5 times 9 and 15 times 3the correct steps for solving this problem are to do 4 times 6 and 1 times 24the steps for solving the problem are to do 5 times 9 and 5 times 8jimmy needs to do 1 times 5 and 3 times 4To get the problem correct you need to doTo get the problem correct  she needs to do 3 timesD\\'angelo needs to do 4 times 7 and 4 times 5anne has to do 4 times 3 and 3 times 2Donna needs to do 3 times 6 and 3 times 4omar needs to do 2 times 5 and 2 times 8es 8I think that Kia should have Found the common denominater first then have added the numbers together.If she did that she would have got the right answer.15/21 is bigger than 15/24 because 15/21 is closer to be a whole number.15/24 is not closer than 15/24.i think that she is right because her modle shows what the number sentence showsbecause 15 is closer to 21 then 15 is closer to 24since it says double it means you have to make both the numerator and dominator the same way by multiplying by 2.7 times 2 does not equle 21 it equles 142 times 2= 4 not 14 times 2=8 and 5 times 2=101 times 2=2 not 3 and 3 times 2=6 not 53 times 2 = 62 times 2 = 4 and 7 times 2 =148 times 2 =16 not 2410 times 3=30 and 6 times 5=3021 times 1 =21 and 3 times 7=218 times 3 = 24 12 times 2 = 24both numbers muliplied by 1 and 2 = 10both equle 12 when multiplyed by 2 and 3both equle 16both equles 45both equle 245/9 is less then 5/83/5 is grater then 1/47/8 is grater then 1/21/4 is less then 2/34/7 is less then 4/53/9 is less then4/63/6 is less then 9/122/5 is grater then 2/8No, because you have to change the denominators.In fractions the less the number the greater it is.pay more attention to the problemPay more attention to the problemNext time use more timenext time dont addDont adddo it rightdo it rightdont addthink before you actim smartthink morethink morereim smartworkworkwork harderwork haredkia is wrong because she subtracted 3 in 3/4 from 7 in 7/9 and got 4.Then she subtracted 4 in 3/4 from 9 in 7/9 and got 5.then she put them together and got 4/5.She should have found the least common denominator for 3/4 and 7/9 then subtract the numorator and keep the dinominator.15/21 is larger than15/24 because if you subtracted 15/24 from 15/21, you would get more than 0 so we know 15/21 is more. Also if you found the least common denominator for both fractions, the numorator would be bigger in the first fraction (15/21).alexander needs to remember that the smallest number that goes into both denominators is the right way to do the problem and correct your multiplycationolivia needs to multiply instead of divide and needs to remember that the largest number that goes into both denominators is the least common denominator.kaitie needs to remember to try and make the number as small as she canremember the smaller  denominator means there is a smaller space to fillwhen your converting fractions, never add something to the numorator. instead, if you want to convert a fraction, find the least common denominator for both fractions and devide the least common denominator by the original fractions denominator and multiply that answer by the original fractions numorator.Kima needs to remember not to make the least common denominator the largest factor for both denominators.Leslie needs to remember to never convert the fraction by adding tha numoratorremember to fixth simblewhen Kia added the fractions, she first added the two denominators together and got 13 as the denominator. then she added 2 and 4 together and got 6 as the denominator. the correct way for adding fractions is finding the least common denominator for each fraction then add the numorators and keep the denominator the same and then you will get your answer.If you made a pictur that are both the same size for both fractions, you can clearly see that 32/45 is bigger than 32/65ergert3w3rYou need to find 2 diffrent numbers that will make each denominator match.You should find out if your smaller denominator can go into your bigger denominator and find out out to get it to the same number.Katiie, you should find the least commen denominator posible instead of just multiplying the denominators together.Ryan, you should find the least common denominator by seeing if your smaller denominator can go into your bigger denominator. If it does then you have to figure how many times it goes into it.You need to learn your math.You have to learn your multiplication facts.You need to use a least commen denominator.YOU NEED TO LEARN YOUR MATH, Dummy!!You needed to find the least commen denominator.You needed to find the least commen denominator.You need to find the least common denominator.You needed to find the least commen denominator.No, because you can not just add the bottoms together.No, because you can not just add the bottoms together. You need to make all the bottoms the same before you add.Actually the one on the right is smaller then the one on the left.no because you never add or subtract the dinominator.So i think shes wrongit\\'s bigger because it takes less numbers to get to 21 then 24you need to double the numerator and the denomanater to get a equivalent fractiondouble your numbersif you add one number you have to add the other oneyou need to get your problem right or else you will get the whole question wrongyou need you add rightif you add one twice you should add the other one twiceyou have to add righthe needs to add righthe need to do his math rightyou need to do your math righthe has  to do his math rightyou need to add rightno beacause you never ever add the denominators thats why he is wrong3232/65 is smaller then 32/45 because the denomanator is biggera least common denometer for 7/9 and 3/4 would be 36. 7/9 = 28/36 and 3/4 = 27/36. If u do 28/36-27/36, you get 1/36. Kia is incorrect.Because the larger the denometer, the smaller the fraction is.Multiply the numerator and denominator by the the same number.He needs to make sure that both denominators go into the LCD.What she needs to do is make sure that all the numbers go into the least common denominator.She needs to make sure both fractions go into the least common denominator.He needs to make sure both numbers go into the least common denominator.He needs to make sure both numbers go into the least common denominator.He needs to make sure that both numbers go into the least common denominator.She needs to make sure that both numbers go into the least common denominator.She needs to make sure both numbers go into the least common denominator.Make sure both numbers go into the least common denominator.He needs to make sure that both numbers go into the least common denominator.She needs to make sure both numbers go into the least common denominator.She needs to make sure that both numbers go into the least common denominatorLeslie needs to make sure she converts the fractions correctly.D\\'Angelo needs to make sure he knows that the bigger the denominator, the smaller the fraction\\'s value.Anne needs to make sure that she has the same denominator for both fractions.Donna needs to make sure that she converts the fractions correctly.Omar needs to make sure that he knows the larger the denominator, the lower the value the fraction has.I think that Kia should have made a least common denominator to find out the answer of 2/8 + 4/5.Because the larger the denominator, the less value the fraction has.her mistask is she add her dernomanator wrongher mistask is she add her dernomanator wrong65 is biger than 45 so you have look in to numarator that is why 32 65ths is smaler than 32 45thsRobert errors were 2 and 27ths those were aspost to be 12 and 18ths.you need to do 10 times three edus  thirdy euyis five times six.you cant solve it because the denomator is diferenttwinty one is smaler  than twinty four so it means that it is smalerdo the multiplacation until you get the 2 same answers and  that should become denominatortry and take the larger number and divide it by the other number then mulipy the second fraction by your answerif you need to just multiply the two denominators to find a common onemultipy the two numbers till you get the same answerjust multiply teh numbers till you get the same answerMultiply the numbers till you get the same answer.if you have the same denominater the larger numerator will make that fraction greatermake sure you multiply the fraction parts by the same numberjust do the multiplacationfind a fraction that is equal to the origanal fractionmake sure the 2 fractions have the same denimantorsshe needs to find a common denominator so you can add thembecause 32 of 45 is a larger portian than 32 of 65I think Kia should find a common denominator and answer her problem.It\\'s smaller because the denominater is bigger.He needs to multiply his answer by 2He needs to multiply his answer by 2multiply your fraction by 2multiply your fraction by 2multiply your fraction by 2multiply your fraction by 2multiply your fraction by 2multiply your fraction by 2multiply your fraction by 2You find a common denominator to solve itYou find a common denominateryou find  common denominaterfind the common denominatorYou have to find a common denominatorya have ta find da common denominatoryou have to find a common denominatoryou have to find a common denominatoryou find a common denominatoryou multiply the denominators togetherYou find a common denominatoryou find a common denominatoryou find a common denominatorfind a common denominatorfind acommon denominatorfind a common denominatorI don\\'t think any of them are equalbecause it\\'s a smaaler denominatorI think that she is correct because she has clear text evidence that she is correct from her picture and i think I am sure beause her adding looks correct and her picture goes with her addition problem. Ithink she is correctI think it is because of the denominator. The reason I think that it is because of the denominator is because the denominator is bigger on the first fraction so it makes the first fraction smaller espiecally when the denominator is smaller on the second fRobert needs to start multipling the same number for    both the numerator and denominator.Alison has to multiply the same number for the denominator just as she did for the numerator.If the denominator is the same then the numerator will have to tell the differince.Jimmy need to multiply the same number he multiplied to get his denominator.I think she is correct because her picture shows the right anwser because the answer looks right to me. Her fraction subtraction is correct i think because 7-3 equals 4 and 9 - 4 equals 5i think it is larger because you can times 15 but you cant times 21 or 24 to get either one of those nmbers so you would know that that is the larger onwi think it is larger because you can times 15 but you cant times 21 or 24 to get either one of those nmbers so you would know that that is the larger oneNo, Kia is not correct. If you make the least common denominator (36), you will end up with 28/360-27/36. The difference of these fractions would be 1/36, which is definitely not equivelent to 4/5. Make the leaNo, Kia is not correct. If you make the least common denominator (36), you will end up with 28/360-27/36. The difference of these fractions would be 1/36, which is definitely not equivelent to 4/5. Make the least common deNo, Kia is not correct. If you make the least common denominator (36), you will end up with 28/360-27/36. The difference of these fractions would be 1/36, which is definitely not equivelent to 4/5. Make the least common denominator (No, Kia is not correct. If you make the least common denominator (36), you will end up with 28/360-27/36. The difference of these fractions would be 1/36, which is definitely not equivelent to 4/5. Make the least common denominator (180). You would have 144/180 and 5/180, and 144/180 (4/5) is obviously morer than 5/180 (1/36).So, Kia is wrong. 7/9-3/4=1/36.15/21 is bigger than 15/24 because the denominator of 21 is smaller, meaning less pieces. That means there are more pieces with denominator 24. Since the numarators are the same, 15/21 is larger than 15/24Robert, you should (a) always check your work before submitting your final answer. (b) When making equivelent fractions, always multiply the denominator AND the numerator. However, you DIVIDED the numerator by 3 and mulpitlied the denominator by 3. You must do the same operation on the denominator and numerator.Alison, when making equivelent fractions, you must multiply or divide the numerator AND denominator by the same number.Venessa, if you are making equivelent fractions, you multiply the denominator and numerator by the same number. You divided the numerator instead of multiply.Alexander, you must make the denominators equal by listing multiples until denominators equal.Olivia, the denominators always must be equal.Kaitie, you want the denominator to be the smallest possible. To do that, list the multiples of each denominator until you find the lowest commen denominator number...Ryan, your denominators should be as small as possible. List the multiples until you get the smallest possible deno0minator.Matt, remember denominators must ALWAYS, i repeat  ALWAYS make the denominators equal. List the multiples until you get the smallest possible denominators.Brad,  the denominators should be THE SAME. List the multiples until you have the smallest possible denominator.Lester, the bigger the numerator the bigger the fraction, unlike the bigger the denominator, the smaller the fraction. Also, you used the incorrect symbol.Jimmy multiply the numerator AND denominator by the same number.KIma,the denominators must be the same, so you dint multiply the denominators OOOORRRR numerator by the same number.Leslie, you didnt correctly multiply. Multiply denominator and numerator by the same number.D\\'Angelo, you used the incorect symbol. Otherwise, your work is good.D\\'Angelo, you used the incorect symbol. Otherwise, your work is good.Kia is wrong because 4/5 0f 1 is alredy more than6/13.It is smaller because the numerators are equal and the denominator is larger in the first fraction, so it is bigger,It is smaller because the numerators are equal and the denominator is larger in the first fraction, so it is bigger.no because they do not have common denominatorsit is smaller because you can still add zeroes to themhe needs to see how many times a number go into the fractionAlison needs to know her  multiplacation facts.she needs to know each change is different.They wont always be the same.He needs to check his work after he is done with that problem.she needs to know her multiple facts.Kaitie nees to know what she is doing in her math problems.Ryan needs to know his facts.matt needs to check over his work.Brad needs tl know his repeated addition facts.Effie needs to know her multiplecation fact that are farther that 10.Sally needs to know her multiplecation facts.He needs to know what a least common denomonator is.he needs to chech his workHe needs to check his work when he is done.She needs to pay more attention in math class.leslie needs to know her multiplecation facts.yes because the dinominator is not the sameit is larger because 21 and 24 are not the sameI think the answer is 1/36 because 9 and 4 aren\\'t common to 5.15/21 is greater because the smaller fraction is worth more than the bigger fraction.he must multiply 6by 2 and 9by2he must multiply 6by 2 and 9by2she needs to multiply by 2she has to multiply by 2She needs to multiply by 2look at hte at the fraction before you answer the promblem.try to find the best nuber those fits inshe has see what to numbers go into each to make one numberhe has to find out lots of nubers that make the product of both numbersmatt has to find a number that is small to fit in the spotfind the biggest number that fitshe needs to find the right number that goes into both fractionsMy answer is 42/40 because she did not use the common denomintor65 is less than 45 when you are talking about fractionsYes because 2+4=6 and 8+5=13.32 is farther from 65 than 45.multiply both numbers by 2 when it says double.multiply by the same number for bothe numbers.Don\\'t divide for the numerator and multiply for the denominator pick the one the problem tells you.if the problem doesent say add dont add multiply.He needs to make sure both problems equal the same thing.make sure they are equal the same number.you cant switch them around.dont switch them around.switch the 2 and the 3.make sure they equal the same thing.switch the 3 and the 5.switch the 1 and the 6.the larger denominator is not the biggest.multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number.multiply by any thing that gets you 8.remultiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number.Yes because 7-3=4 and 9-4=5.15/21 is larger because 15 is closer to 21 then 24.No because 2/8 + 4/5 = 42/40.  Then to simplfy you do 42/40 goes to 1 2/4032/65 because 45 is larger than 4532/65 because 65 is larger than 45when 6 and 9 go to the same numbermulitply the same number for each part of the fractionyou need to multiply the numbers the same way fractiondo not add the number multiply itYou need to multiply and not addmultiply by the same numbermultiply the same numbermultiply the same numberwhat can 6 and 10 get to closer21 divided by 3 is 7you need to find out what 12 and 8 is close toyou need to see what 5 and 10 are closer to.Matt needs to multiply the closer number to 6 and 4Matt needs to multiply the closest number to both 6 and 4.Brad needs to multiply the 8 times the number to get to 16Effie has to find the least common denominator.Sally needs to find the least common denominrator that can go in 4 and 24Lester multipled the wrong number for the numoratorJimmy multiplied the the top numoraters on each fraction incorectlyKima did not make the denominators are the same.no she is wrong you do not subtract the deninroratorBecause 15/21is less than  15/24  because 24 is more than 21 so its the oppisiteno because the denominater for the answer is not in the to numderbecause the denominater is bigger than the other wich takes more space then the otherRobert you need to multiply 2 times not threeAlison you need to multiply by 2 not 3Vanessa you need to multilpy 2 for the numeratorRaj you need to multiply by 2Jamal you need to multiply by 2Victor you need to multiply by 2Mary you ned tomultiply by 2Otis you need yo multiply by 2Alexander you are of this problem because you are two lowerOlivia you are 3 least common to the answerKatitie your problem is that is 96 keast commonRyan your problem is 50 least commonMatt your problom is 2 least commonBrad your problem is 8 least commonEffie your problem is 3 least commonSally your problem is 4 least commonLester the asnwer is that 5 over 9 is smaller than 5 over 8Jimmy the answer is 18 over 20 is bigger than 17 over 20Kima you are rongeLeslie your problem is rongeD\\'Angle your problem is rongeAnne your problem is rongeDonna your problem is rongeOmar your problem is rongeyou need to find a number that 9 and 4 have the same number and simplifybecause the denominater is small than the othershe cant get that answer because 2/8 plus 4/5 is bigger than 6/13It is smaller because its not even halfIt is smaller because 32 is not even half of 65 but 32 is more than half of 45He needs to double the numbers one at a time double six write down and then double 9 write it down.make sure you doubling them not triplingmake sur your either doubling or dividing not bothhii hope you do wellits the smallest numbermake sure he does the smallest answeruse the smallest number ggyou need a number that goes in bothmake sure the number goes in bothsmallest numberit opens to the bigger onecheck your workchecknake sure your multipling bothhihihiit opens to the bigger oneI think she does show that but her answer is wrongit is larger because the denominator is smallerNO becasue she added the numerator and the denomonator together. You would have to find the LCD of both number which would be 40 and the product of the 2 fractions would be greater than 1.45Becasue the smaller the fraction is the bigger the whole will be. If you have a larger fraction denominator, it would be a smaller whole.Whatever you do to the numerator you must do to the denominator or your ansewr will be incorrect. Do not add or subtract finding equivalent fractions. When making equivalent fractions you only use  multiplacation or division.When finding least common denomantors, make sure your products are the same.When finding least common denomators, make sure your products are the same.She should make sure both of her denomitors are the same product. She should find all the common multiples of each number.Make sure you always find t common denominator least or you will need to simpify alot.First find LCD and that would be 72.  Since they both have the same denominators now, multiply it by either 8 or 9  depends what the numarator is for the origanal fraction. Make sure your symbol is facing the right way so yo are not making a stupid error.Always find LCD first. Be sure to check that your fraction the is being compared converts back into the fraction you started with that didn\\'t have LCD yet.She didn\\'t do  math right. She subtracted the numorators and the denomanators. First, you havte to find LCD then how many times the denomonator goes into that number, multiply that by the numorator.When you have a small denomanator, it will be a big fraction. When you have a big denomanator, you will have a small fraction.Robert, you should not multiply the numerator and divide the denominator.  You should multiply both or divid both.        Sincerely,   Kari L.you need to see what multiple wiil go into both equationsyou need to see what the largest number that will go into both denomi ators isyou must see what product could be used with both numbersyou need to see what number  can be used with both numbersyou need to see what  numbers times 4 and 6 wiil give you the same productyou must see what number will go into both numbersyou must make both fractions have common denominators to se which fraction is biggeryou must multiply the numerator & denominator by the same thingmake both fractions have common denominatorsdo not add the numeratorsI think Kia is wrong because 7/9 and 4/5 are almost equal and if subtract something, the difference should be less than the number or fraction you started withbecause the closer together the numerator and denominator are, the bigger the fraction isI don\\'t think that her answer makes sense because the denomanator for 7/9 and 3/4, the 9 and the 4 are not equal.So her answer does not make sense.The denomanator 21,in 15/21,the pieces will be larger than the denomanator 24, in 15/24.The pieces will be larger because 21 is a smaller number that 24,leaving there to be pieces to be there.He needs to know the multiplacation problems for the numbers he is working with.That will help him with the problem.Alison needs to check her work when she is finished. Alison is doing the wrong math problems.Vanessa should learn about fractions and ceaced her work . She should look at her answerAlex should look over his work more ang should try to look at the least common denominatorsOlivia should look at her proplems first then cheak it then look at it and seer if it is rightKatie needs to check her work when she is finished.

look at your answer more before you give it to people to look at and going to look at things that are wrong.I think that Kia didn\\'t do her problem correctly.She added her denomanators when you NEVER add the denomanators.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because both of the numerators are the same,but the denomanators are different.Robert, you need to change 6 9ths to 12 18ths you made the numorater smaller then it should be and the denominator larger then it should beAllison, you probbly just messed up in the problem somewhere. maybe you should practice more for you\\'re own goodDear Vanessa, you might have mixed up your multiplying somewhere along the lines of the problemRaj, you messed up your additon with multiplecation maybe you\\'re not ready for this kind of thinkingyour chande in fractions is addition Raj, you must have gotten off trackVictor, you messed up in your Numerator and denomenator change ddifferentyou need some help with your mathOtis you got the ansewer close you just messed up a littleyou messed up with your mutiplecation maybe you should get some help with thisyou need to change the numbers that go into both denomenatorsuse the product of both denomenators to ansewer your problemchange the product of both denomenatoryou need to change the smallest numbers that go into bothe denomenatoresbrad put the largest numbers that go into both denomenatorschange the smallest number that goes into both denomenatorsyou need to change the comaparisonyou added the nummerator in sted of multiplyingthe lcd is the largest factor for both denomenatorsno she subtracted the fractions cant do thatbecause it has a smaller denomenatorthe peices that are not shaded are not the correct pecies of the fraction the shaded ones are the correct fractionfirst, some times you have to multiply your nuneratror and denominator to see if it is equivelent and you can divide toojust multiply the numerator and denominator rightpizzaFirst, you multiply and divide to equel the answer you are looking formultiply  not addmultiply by the same number for the denominator and numeratorshe is wrong.Because you dont add denominatorsbecause the smaller the denomenator the smaller the fraction.kia is right because 7-3=4 and 9-4=5it is bigger because the smaller number at the bottom is always bigger that the top and the number at the bottom its always bigger that the smaller numberDear Robert,   If the problem asks to double the numbers you multipy the numbers/number by two.Dear Allison, You multiplyed the denominator by 3, when you were supposed to do 7+7... not  7times3.dear Vanessa,   you subtracted from the numerator instead of adding 2 on to makde it double.adding itself to itself.make sure the bigger number goes into both denominators not the smallestthe smallest number goes into both denominators in this problemyou did the wrong steps you did 8times1=16 itis accually 8 times 3 =24 and 12 times 2 =24 so 24 is the main number you need in this problemyou did 10 times 5 which is 50 and 5 times 10 which is 50the fractions are right in the picture and in the adding answerits smaller because 45 is bigger in fractionsTO SEE THAT BOTH EQASTIONS ARE EQUAL TO THE ANWSER.YOU NEED TO HAVE EQLIVENT EQUSTIONS TO GET THE RIGHT ANWSERYOU NEED TO SEE THAT THE PROMLEMS ARE THE SAME ANWSERS WHEN YOU WOULD MULTIPLYEY.THEY ARE EQULVANT PROMLEMSto make shure your mutipction is creccthe multiplided the wrong numberShe needs to compare correctlyShe needs to compare and multiply right.he had the sible the wrong waythe timesing was wrongshe had the wrong nuber to timeshe copared wrobng sijbleShe cant because the denominators are not the same.If you change the denominators 32 over 65 is smaller than 32 over 45.i think  she is wrong becuase you can not add the denominatores togerther and she addeed 4+2=6 that is right  becuase she was wrong is becuase you can not add the denominatoresit is wrong because 32 is the same but 65 is not smaller than 45 so she is wrong.he needs to do 6 times 6 =12 then he needs to do nine times 2=18She needs to do 5 times 2=10 and do 7 times 2=14 there is her answershe needs to do 2+2 =4 then she needs to do 8*2=16She needs to do 4+4=8 and 5+5=10 so her answer would be 8 tenthsshe needs to do 6 times 5 times 30 times3 that is what  she should have doneIf Olivia did 21 times 1 it would be 21 if you did 7 times 3 =21 so they both will have a denominator of 21If you do 12 times 2 =24 and if you do 8 times 3 =24 so your answer is 24If you do 5 times 8= 40+5 =45 that answer is 45 over 72 and 5times 9 = 45-5 =40 so your answer is 40 over 72If you do 4 times 3 =12 and 5 times 4 =20 so that answer is 12 over 20 and 1 times 5 =5 and 4 times 5 = 20 so that is 5 over 203i think that 7-3 =4 is right but you can not add the denominatorers to the get 5it is egual because 15 and 15 is the sames then 21 you just wen up3 so your goodI think that Kia is wrong because she added the denamanter and you are Never suposest to added the denamanter.I think that 32 and 65 is bigger than 32 and 45. I think this because 65 is bigger than 45 and the denatanater is suppost to be bigger than one or the other denamanter.Think about just one problem at a time not two.Only think about one problem at a time. It might make it more easy to doOnly think about one problem at a time.Only think about one problem at a time.Only think about one problem at a time.Only think about one problem at a time.Only do one problem at a time.Only do oneonly look at one problem at a time.Only think about one problem at a timehiOnly look at one problem at a time, you can cover one up.Only think about one problem at a timeOnly look at one problem at atime.Only think of one problem at a time.Only look at 1 problem at a time it helps me.Kia is wrong because you are never ever aloud to add the numbers on the bottom together.15?, I dont know.the numerator is 2 4 it would equal 6 then add the denominator that are 8 and 5 and that equals 13 and can be a fraction so it would be 6\\\\13because if you cut up 32\\\\45 it has smaller pieces that is why it is bigger than 32\\\\65She 5/7 she have of done 2/7 b\\\\c there were 7 pieces and 2 shade inHe did 7/9 b/c he though 2 left over and 7 shadedb\\\\c 6 is half of 12 and 9 is half of 18 so we did 12\\\\18B/c 5 is half of 10 and 7 is half of 14 so we did 10\\\\145half of 12 is 6 and 3 + 3=67i know that 7\\\\9 is allmost a whole because if you added 2 more pieces it would be a whole or 9\\\\9 now 3\\\\4 if you added 1\\\\4 it would be a whole or 4\\\\4 now 4\\\\5 is allmost a whole because if you added 1 more you would of got 5\\\\5if made a  circle and you cut 21 pieces and shaded in 15 you would of got 6if made a  circle and you cut 21 pieces and shaded in 15 you would of got 6 and 15\\\\24 if you made a circle and shaded 15 you would have 3 left overshe is wrong because 2she is wrong because 2she is wrong because 2she is wrong because she added the denominators which you should never ever do!32/65 is smaller then 32/45 because 65ths are smaller peices then 45ths.study and double your numerator and denominator.study and double the numerator and denominator.study and double your numerator and denomanator.learn your equvilent addition problems.learn your equvilent fractions.learn your equvilent multiplacationlearn your equvilent multipacationlearn your higher and lower fractions.learn your lesser and greater fractions.learn your lesser and greater fractionslearn your lesser and greater fractions.learn your lesser and greater fractions.learn your lesser and greater fractions.learn your lesser and greater fractions.learn your lesser and graeter fractions.i think kia is wrong because she messed with the problem by adding the denominators together which you should never do.15/21 is larger than 15/24 because the peices are only split in to 21 which is larger than 24.i think that is wrong because seven ninths minus three fourths is impossable so she needs to fix her misstakethe pieces are larger than twentyfourthsfirst you need to multiply 9 by 2 then 6 by 2 the you put the two in the correct palces then you have the awnserfirst you have to multiply by 2 u first multiply the numarater and the denominater by 2 and the you have the awnserYou have to double the numerator to get the answer.You have to multiply to get 30 or the number that both can multiply to get.you have to look at the numbers carefully the multiply to get the same awnserthe larger one was the 5 eights he put the greater than less than sighn backwordsthe denomaters are suppost to be the same numberBoth denominators are equivilant. Divide the first numerator and denominator, and multiply the second.I think that she thinks she can add the denomanaters to have a bigger denomater because the numarater will be larger than the denomanaterbecause the denomnater is smaller than the outher oneHe needs to wright down the multiples of 10 and 6 and find out wich one is the lowest.she should write down multiples for 21 and 3.she should write down the multiples of 12 and 8.multiply the fractions 72 times 45 and 72 times 40.multiply the numerator with another denominator for bothmultiply the numerator with the oppistite denominator.multiply the numerator with the oppistie denomenatorShe added the denominators and she cant add the denominators so her answer is wrong.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 is because 45 is smaller than 65.I know that the numerator should not be shown by the non-shaded pieces.It shoud be the shaded  peices that you are suppost to count for the numorator.That is how I know that Jordan is wrong.robert said 2 over 27 witch was wrong. it shoud have been 12 over 18 becuase it says make an equivalent fraction to the given fration witch is six over nine.it also states that you have to double the numerator.6 and multiplyed by 2 and 9 multipyed by 2the rule is the larger the denominator is the smaller the  fraction and the smaller the denominator is the bigger the fraction is.if the denominators are the same.look at the num. and see wicth one is larger.then you can put > or <.ALL the denomators have to be the samethe bigger the denomator the smaller the peciesyou need to multiply or divide by the SAME thing to get the correct equivelent fractiondo the multiples FIRST  do 6, then 10, then 6, then 10 over and over again until you get the number of times you did that for BOTH and what they matched up as.what I did I was like wait! lets see if 3 goes into 27 FIRST and when I did I found out that 27 IS a multiple of 3 so just check and see if the lower number has the higher number as a multipledo some multiples of the multiples of them in ths case do 12, then 8 ,then 12, then 8 and keep doing the process until you\\'ve got matching nubersmake sure that just in case if the lower number is a factor of the higher number if it is look at how many times you did that and the higher number at 1 and lower at how many times it took you to get to the numberdo the multiples in this case 6, 4, 6, 4 until you get matching numberscheck if the lower number divides (is a factor of) the higher number but toy did 8 times 1 trying to do 16 divided by 2 but with the multiplecation signdo multiples in this case 15, 9, 15, 9 until you get matching numberssee if the lower number is a factor of the larger numberusualy the SMALLER denominator is largerdo NOT add the numerator and multiply the denominator if youu add ONLY the numerator is added and in multiplecation BOTH the numerator and denominator is multiplyedthe 0 is the ONLY big line that isn\\'t part of the fraction on a number linewhen multiplying you multiply BOTH the numerator and the denominator when adding ONLY the numerator is added.USUALY the smaller denominator is the greater one if you don\\'t see the diffrence then put one of them on top and one on the bottom THEN you SHOULD be able to see the diffrenceyou had put the LARGEST common denominator you shoud have had the LEAST common denominatorONLY the NUMERATOR is ADDED and BOTH the NUMERATOR and the DENOMINATOR is MULTIPLYEDI think that she is wrong because she isI think that she is wrong because 180, its simplist form it is then 20 - 45 which is not 36 it is -25.It is because 21 is a smaller number so more is filled up.Dear Robert, you multiplied by 3 for but, divided 6 by 3 when you needed to multiply by 2.Dear Alison, multiplied 7 by 3 when you should have multiplied 7 by 2 like you did with the 5.dear vannesa, you divided 2 by 2 when you should have multiplied it by 2.Dear Raj, you added 3 when you should have multiplied by 2.Dear Alexander / Alex, you should\\'ve found the number that most of the other numbers could not fit into.dear olivia you should have multiplied 21 by1, and 3 by 7.dear katie you multiplied to high you should havefor the simplest form.dear ryan you multiplied to high and you didn\\'t use the simplest formDear, Matt you should have made them both th same product in simplist formdear brad you should have done 8 by 2 and 16 by 1dear effie, you should have done 1fifteen by three and nine by five to get forty-fivedear sally you should have done 4 by 6 an 24 by 1dear lester, you should have multiplied 9 by 8 and 5 by 8 and 5 by 9hey jim, youshould have multiplied 3 by 4, 5 by 4, 1 by 5, and 4 by 5heykima you should have done 8 as the denominator.hey leslie/sally, you should have multiplied 1 by 3, 4 by 3, 2 by 4, and 3 by 4Dear D\\'Angelo, you shoild have done seven by five, four by five, five by seven, and four by sevenI think that she is wrong because you don\\'t add the denominator you make them both have the same denominator then add the numerators together.It is because 65 is greater than 45 so less is filled in.I think it is wrong. It is wrong because you have to find the common denominator and then add you can\\'t just add witput finding the common denominator32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because the denominator in 32/65 is bigger than 32/45. That effects the answer because 32/65 would not fill as much up, but 32/45 would nearly fill it up all the waykeeep adding dodnominators until you get the same number and you could multiply the two donominators togetherjust keep ading the donominators together until you get the same nummberAlways try to find the LCD don\\'t just multiply the denominators together.try to find the LCD and dont just randomly multiplty.do not just multiply numbers because you will get a random LCDLester should not think that the bigger the number the bigger the fractionFor the numerator he can not just add random numbersTry to find the LCD not just any common denominatordont put random stuff for the numerator ; )the lager numerator is the bigger frraction if the denominator is the sameTry  find the LCD and not just any commen donminatorhi. dont just add the numerator and donominator and think that is your finnal anwserIt is wrong because she didn\\'t find a common denominator she just subtracted the numerators together and the denminators together and assumed that 4/5 was the answer.15/21 is larger than 15/24 because the denominator in 15/21 is smaller than 15/24 so 15 of 21 fills up more where as 15 of 24 does not fill up quite as much as 15/21.She is wrong because when you add fractions you have to find the least common denomintor and she didn\\'t find that so it is wrong her final answer is supposed to be 1 and one twentith.32 over 65 is smaller because that means 32 of the 65 and the other fraction means 32 of the 45 so it has less of a range from the denomintor and if you see the range from 32 over 65 it has a greater distance.Robert needs to do the same thing to the denominator also to the numeratorDo the same thing to the denominator and the numerator.What ever you do to the denominator for the first fraction has to be related to the other denominator fraction.Again you have to do the same thing to the denominator to the first fraction also to the second fraction.Always find the least common denominator and it should be small.you have to find the lest common denonatorand itAlways find the least common denominator!!!!!!COMMON DENOMINATORSFind the least common denomintor.Again find the least common denominatorLook at the problem carefullyFind the least common denominatorKeep the same denominatorLook at the problems\\\\She has to find the least common denominator and then do the same thing to the numerator as you did to the numerator then you are ready to subtractShe has to find the least common denominator and then do the same thing to the numerator as you did to the numerator then you are ready to subtract.It is greater becauIt is greater because when you find the least common denominator you will see that the number is greater because the denominators are both going to be the same also when you do that you will see that one is greater than the otherIt is greater because when you find the least common denominator you will see that the number is greater because the denominators are both going to be the same also when you do that you will see that one is greater than the other.i think she wrong .7/9 is= to 4/5. so 7/9-3/4=4/5i think she wrong .7/9 is= to 4/5. so 7/9-3/4=4/5 is not a equshondo  not know36they have to be multeeplied by the same numberyou.i do not knowi do not knowdo not knowi do not know555555the middle one bigger than the answerdifferent denoenatrskia did it wrong. her was correct,but her picture of the problem was wrong. she was one less than her answerIt is basically like the oppisite. The bigger the donomanator is the smaller the fraction is.check your work always and check your multiplacationcheck your work  and always check your multiplacationcheck your work and your multiplacation all the timecheck your work and your multiplacation all the timecheck your work and your multiplacation all the timecheck your work and your multiplacationcheck your work and multiplacationcheck your work and multiplacationpay attention and check your workpay attention and check your workpay attention and check your workpay attention and check your workcheck your work and pay attentioncheck your work and pay your attentioncheck your work and pay attentioncheck your work and pay attentioncheck your workcheck your workcheck your workcheck your workshe is rightbecause 21 is smaller than 24I think that is wrong because kia thought that 4+5=9 so a denominator of 4 and 5 would equal a denominator of 9.you should multiply both numbers the same amount instead of dividing one and multiplying one.you should multiply the numerator and denominator the same amount like multiplying both by 2 instead of 1 by 2 and 1 by 3.you should multiply both numbers or divide both  numbers instead of dividing one by 2 and multiply one by 2You should make sure the aswer makes sense. Do not put 6 times 5 equals 20 equals 10 times 2 because you know 6 times 5=30, not 20.You should pick a smaller number to try first when finding last common denominators and make sure the problem makes sense. Do not putsomthing like 21 times 2 equals 21 because you know 21 times 2=42.You should try to use small numbers first because  the lowest number that goes into both is corect. You might think 12 times 8 = 96 so 8 times 12 would be the answer but, 12 times 2 = 24 and 3 times 8 does to and the numbers are much lower.You should try lower numbers first because the aswer is the lowest posible aswer that makes sense.You should make sure your aswer makes sense. Dont put 6 times 3=12=2 times4 becase you know 6 times 3 = 18 not 12.You should look and see which numerator is bigger. the fraction with the bigger numarator is bigger if the denaminators are the same.You should multiply the numerator and denominator by the same ammount. If they arre multiplyed diffrently it is not an equalivent fraction.You should make sure the 2 fractions have the same denominator. If they dont it can not be an equalivent fractionYou should make sure you multiply the numerator and denominator in a fraction by the same number. If you do not the fracion cant be equalivent.You should make sure you multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number. If you dont it cant be anequalivent fraction.I think she is incorrect because to add fractions they have to have the same denominators.It is smaller cause win the numerators are the same the number with the smaller denominator is bigger.Her picture is incorrect because she did not do common demomonaters and subtracked straight across the problem would be 28/36 -27/36 =1/3615/21 is closer to a whole number than 15/24 isRobert could multiply 9 times 2 and 6 times 2 because he did 9 times 3 and 6 divided by 3 and that was not correctshe needs to do the problem by doubling not tripling the denominator to get 10/14 not 10/21The tip I would give Vanessa could be to multiply 2 times 2 and 8 times 2. But if she gets it correct it would be 4/16 not 1/16He swiched the two numbers 5 and 3 and made the product 1 not 30.  He should get 6 times 5 and 3 times 10 witch should get 30 for both.she mixed ud up the numbers because they would not get the same least common denominatorshe had the largestcommon denominator that goes into both denominatorsshe hadhe did the smallest number that goes into bothHe needs to look at the problem again and thinke about it.Brad, you did pretty good. You just need to look at at the problem carefullyhe needs to read the promblem again and look at it some more toget the right answerhe needs to look at iaction more carefullyt closerShe is wrong because the common denominator is 40 and the fracktions would be 10/40 + 32/40 =1 1/20It is because 32/65 is cut into more sections than 32/45 isShe didn\\'t find the least common denomonator. I could not see what her unsimplified answer was. she just made her question in picture form65 is split up in to more peices than forty five. the pices split into 65ths are smaller than split into just 45 pieseswhen you multiply the denomonator to get an equivilan fraction multiply the numorator the same number of times as the denomonatormultiply the numorator the same number of times as the denomonatormultiply the denomonator the same number of times as the numorator:)Dont add when making equivilent fractions. you have o multiplyNEVER ADD!!!!!!!!!!! when you are mutiplying fractions or its not equivilentmultiply the numor atr the same number of times as the denomonatornever add when you doble the fraction. if your dobling you multiply both the numorator and denomonator by 2.Multiply the numorator the same amount of times as te denomonatormakshure  the lcd is biger than 1 or els every thing woud go into onethe numbers must be able to go into echother dont devide to find the lcd.Make sure its the Least COMMON denomonator. you can multiply them together if one numbers odd and ones evennever multiply the denomonators to gether unless nothing else worksnever use one as a lcd or else every number goesinto it. youcan use the smallest denomonator as an lcd or you can make it smallernever devide the smallest denomonator. multiply,never use one as an lcdnever devide for an lcdThe number with the biger denomonator and the same numorator as the smaler one is allways bigerNever add when converting fractionMake shure the denomonators are the same when you convertNever add when converting numoratorThe larger denomonater is smaller than the smaller denomonator.#confusingmake sure the lcd is the sameNevr addThe smaller denomonator is biger ifthesmaller demomonator have the fractionfind the lcd first whats the lcdits split up into bigger pieses than 24you always need to try evrey number to get the answer wright by starting with the number 1 and then 2.you need to start with number 1 then 2,3,4,and5 then if you try every number then you will get it right.the advice i\\'m giving you is just keep the numbers that you have but change the simbol that you have.Some advice i am giving you is change the number where the five is then put the number five in then press ok.You neded to change the number to make it  four then press ok and then you will get it right.i\\\\i\\\\I think it equals 0 because both of the shaded parts on the models equal the same thing.15/21 is greater than 15/24 because when you have a larger denominator there is usually less pieces left over. When you have a smaller denominator you usually have more pieces left over.That is why I think 15/21 is greater than 15/24.Robert tripled the numbers when he was supposed to only double the numbersAlison needed to double seven instead of triple sevenvanessa had to double the 2raj does not know his multiplication because 4+4=8 not 7 or 4times 2 = 8 and 5+5 or 5 times 5 = 10Jamal should have doubled both the denominator and the numerator.alexander needs to keep going untill he gets the same product for both problems and the first product they get the same is the correct least common denominatorolivia had to multiply 3 times 7 to get 21 and 21 times 1 to get 21 and the least common denominator is 21Katie did not do the least common denominator she did one of the higher common denominators instead of the least common denominator which is 24 not 96 but at first me and my friend thaught it was right until we figured out that it wasn\\'t the least common denominator.Like the other person, Ryan found one of the  higher denominators instead of the least common denominator.Matt had to get the least common denominator instead of one of the highest denominatorslester had to change the sign to make 5/9 greater than 5/8.lester needs to change the less than sign to the greater than sign because 45/72 is greater than 40/72jimmy didnt convert the 3/5 correctly so since he ddnt do the right thing he got it wrongthe common denominator is 8 because 2 is a factor of 8 and 1 is also a factor of 8 so the 7/8 would stay the same and the 1/2 would go to 4/8I think Kia is right. I think Kia is right because the first model shows 2/8. The second model shows 4/5. The last model shows 6/13. So you can see that is why I think Kia is right.32/65 is greater tha 32/45 because when you have a larger denominator the fraction is smaller.Where as when the denominator is smaller the fraction is larger. So you can see that is why 32/65 is smaller than 32/45.Dear Alexander, here is some advice I thought of to help you with topic: 1. Try to make the denominator the same thing. 2. Make sure you are making an EQUIVELENT FRACTION!!!    Sincerely, GraceDear Olivia here is some advice... 1. you need to make sure you are multiply by the same number 2. You also should have the same denomonater. Sincerely,  Graceyour denomenators should be the sameYou have to make it so that the denominators are the sameUse the least cmmon denominatorDear Jimmy, Make sure you are  converting the fractions the right wayI think you should find a common denemonater15/21 is larger than 15/24 because the denonater is larger.USE YOUR HEAD!!!YOU HAVE A HEAD!2 x 4 is NOT 1stop sleeping in classuse your HEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!MULTIPLY!MEAMULTIPLY!!!!!give me meatloafuse yal brainsi just wrote this in hear so i can move onlights!,camera!,ME!!!!hiIM GOING TO THE STORE!!MEA!HI!use yore headno addingnonannanwork hard play hardim thinking that this is wrongit is like opisitsit is like opisits   -sry i spelt it wrongI do not think that is right becausethe size of two forthsI do not think that is right becausethe size of two forths woud make five fiths (i used my fingers to estamet  the size of the fracsions)smailler the denoanator, the closer you are to the numberyou need to double the numerator and the denomanater to get a equivalent fractiondouble your numbersif you add one number you have to add the other oneyou need to get your problem right or else you will get the whole question wrongyou need you add rightif you add one twice you should add the other one twiceyou have to add rightadd rightaddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd rigggggggghtTo get the corret answer you have to get two numbers that multiply and get the same answer.You have to get two numbers that will multiply up to the same number.he needs to add righthe need to do his math rightyou need to do your math righthe has  to do his math rightyou need to add righti think she is correctthe bottem number is lager, that means the smaller number is closer to 15kia is wrong because she just subtracted 7-3=4 and 9-4=5 when she supposed to find the least comman dempotmers.15/21 is larger that 15/24 because the more u go up the bigger the fraction is.instead of dividing  6 from 3 you muliply 6 times 2. instead of mulipying 9 times 3. you should muiply 9 times 2.you need to see what can both numbers can go into like 5 times 6= 30 and 3  times 10 = 30you need to figure out what numbers go into both denominatorkia needs to see what number can go in to the demonter.for the numator she needs to see what number  goes into the demonter and muliply it to get the numator.32/65 is smaller because bigger it get is the smaller one.yes she can because she subtracted 7/9-3/4=4/5 correctly.it is greater because you split 1 whole 24 times and filled in 15. since you split 1 whole 21 times you have bigger pieces that fill up 1 whole more.multiply by 2 to the numerator and denominatormultiply by the same numberdo not add one and subtract the otherdo not add numbers together you have to use a multiplelook carefully at your multiplyinglook carefully at your multiplyingwhat your addingwhat your multiplyingdo not subtractdo not dividewatch the multipleswatch your multiplesgreater looking fraction is not always greaterdo not addwatch your multiplesdo not addtake your timewatch your multiplestake your timeno because is 4/5 greater than 6/1332/65 is smaller than 32/45 because you cut 1 whole into 65 pieces and 45 pieces are greater pieces.He needs to either multiply or divide the numerator and denominator .If you doble one of them you half to double the otherHe has to make both equations tp equal the same productEach factor needs to equal the same product.She has to find the least common denominator that the one she had wasn\\'t the least common denominatoreach factor needs to equal the same productyou got it right. Great jobYou got the deenominator right but you forgot to multiply the numerator by the denomanator numberYou did not find the least common denomanator, you had 2 and 8 cant go into 2You have to multiply the numerator by the denomanators numberYou just  got the number sign wrongthe denomanators were not the sameYou have to convert the fractions by the numerator that was addedYes , she is right she has 2/8, 5/4, and 6/13.It is smaller because if the denominator is bigger that  gives it\\'s sections smaller value.i think she should make all the fractions havei think she should make all the fractions have the same denomatator so she could add propplyif you get the lcd it turns out that 32/65 is smaller than 32/45DO MATH BRO P.S I AM A hush pupyuse a coulator brobe gr8 at meth#NAME?nald it like a bosstakes practicepratic morewe triedshe should make them havethe same lcdshe should make them have the same lcdwhen the lcd is the same (lel) 15\\\\21 >15\\\\24when the lcd is the same (lel) 15\\\\21 >15\\\\24when the lcd is the same (lel) 15\\\\21 >15\\\\24lelwhen the lcd is the same (lel) 15\\\\21 >15\\\\24I think that 2  8th +  4 5th = 6 13th\\'sThe piece is larger than the othervvvvv6*5=30=3*10                                                                                         Then  you  have the smallest  number that goes into both denominators . So that was Alexander\\'s mistakes.40/72 is equal to 5/9 72is the denomantor12/20=3/5 > 5/20=1/4 20 was the denomator for each fraction.7/8 is equal to 7/8 than1/2 is equal to 4/8 than the denomantorIt does NOT make any sence at all beacause you dont subtract the bottem nummber they allways stay the same never diffrent.It is a larger piece it subtracts more than 15/21I think its wrong because she added the dnamanatorIts smaller because the bigger  the number the smaller the fraction isRobert, you need to know that equivalent fractions are fractions that are doubled ,tripled , and so on.Alison,you need to know that you don\\'t just double the numerator,but also the denominator.Vanessa,you need to know to not subtrakad any part of the fraction to make an equivalent fraction.Alexander,even though 1 means a whole you don\\'t use it as a least common denominator.Olivia,the least common denominator is not the sum of the problem.Lester,the first fraction is not larger than the second.Jimmy,3x4 is not 18,it is 12.Kima,sometimes the least common fraction can be the same as the common fraction.Leslie,you do not add the numorator when you multiply the demoninatorD\\'Angelo,the first frqaction is larger than the second.Anne,once you find out that  what the least common denomanator is, use it as the denomanator for both of the fractionsDonna,once you figure out what the least common denomanator is,Omar,the first numberline is larger than the second.Kia did it wrong because she subtract the denomenator.Its larger because the bigger the denomerator the smaller the fraction is.Alexander needs to know his multiplacation facts, he also needs to know the smallest number that goes into to bothe denominators is the least common denominator.Olivia needs to know what the least common denominator is. She can do that by knowing her facts and multiples.Katie needs to know her multiplacation facts and the common denominators for fractions.Lester didnt multiply right. He should work on his facts.Jimmy didnt multiply right.Kima did not multiply right.Leslie didnt multiply right.D\\'Angelo needs to know that the larger denominator is the larger fraction.Anne needs to know the least common denominators for fractions.Donna needs to know the least common denominators of fractions.Omar needs to know that the fraction with larger denominator is the larger fraction.No because you have to make the denominators the same number. Kia did it wrong. She just added across the fractions.Its smaller because it has a larger denominator.Its smaller because it has a larger denominator.I think that Kia is incorrect because the least common denominator of 2/8 and 4/5 is 40 and 2/8 changes to 10/40 and 4/5 changes to 32/40. 10/40 + 32/40 = 1 2/40. 1 2/40 doesn\\'t divide equally into thirteenths, so Kia is incorrect.32/65 is less than 32/45 because 65>45 which means that the denominator 65 has smaller parts than the denominator 45.  Since 45ths are greater than 65ths 32/65<32/45.Robert should double check his. Also qif he changes the denominator you have to do the same thing the numerator.Allison  should remember that if she dose something to the denominator, she has to do the same thing to the numerator.Vennessa needs to remember that whatever she does to the denominator she has to do the same thing to the numerator.Raj needs to remember to not add the fractions and to multiply them.Jamal needs to remember that he has to multiply frations, not add them.Victor needs to remember that whatever he did to the denominator he has to do the same with the numeratorMary needs to remember that she has to multiply fractions not add them.Alexander should remember to multiply thr right numbers.Olivia has to remember that both products have to be the same.Katie needs to remember that she has to find the smallest multiple of both denominators.Ryan needs to remember to find the smallest multiple of both denominartorsMatt needs to remember to make sure that his least common denominator is a multiple of both denominators.Brad had to find a common denominator for both numbersEffie needs to remember to multiply the right numbers .Sally needs to make sure that she multiplies the numbers by the correct numbers.Lester needs to make sure he compares the fractions the right way.Jimmy should remember to multiply the numerators.Kima needs to make sure she finds the least common denominator.Leslie should remember to multiply to get the numerator.D\\'Angelo should compare the fractions using the numerators.Anne should find the right least common denominator.Donna needs to multiply the numerator to get the correct answer.Omar needs to compare the fractions correctly.I think that she is incorrect because 7/9-3/4 is equal to 28/36-27/36, and 28/36-27/3I think that Kia is incorrect because 7/9-3/4 is equal to 28/36-27/36, and 28/36-27/36 = 1/36, and 1/36 is not equal to 4/5.15/21 is greatrer than 15/24 because twenty-fourths are smaller than twenty-firsts.hhshskfhfhhit lists that 7/9-3/4=4/5 in fraction barswhat you do to the denomintator you do the numerator too.so what you do to the denominator you do to the numeratorfind the least common denominator that both number go into. 10 and 6 would be 30she needs to find the least common denominator like the largest number that goes into both denominatorsshe needs to find the smallest nubmber that goes into both denominators not just random numbers50 is correct but you want the smallest possible denominator 10find the lcd stands for least common denominatorfind lcd least common deninomatorfind lcd least common denominatorTHE LCD ILCDLCDLCDLCDshe will need to find the LCD first then add to make it much easierif there are more pieces, then the fraction is smaller because eating 2/3 of a pizza is more than eating 2/4 of a pizza because there are more people sharing it.He needs to read carefully and needs to look at the right sign.He needs to find LCD and make the right answer.She should pay attention to the two numbers in the problem.She needs to list the multplys of both numbers.list the mutiples from 5 then 10He needs to learn the smaller the  denomotor the greater.Pay attention to the deonmatoirI think that Kia is wrong because 7/9 and 3/4 are nearly equal. Therefore, subtracting the two would end up with a number lower than both fractions. Instead, it came up with more than 3/4!The two fractions have an uncommon denominator, and the smaller the denominator with an equal numerator is bigger.Just multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number to get an equivilent fractionMultiply both halves of the fraction by the same number to get an equivalent fraction!Be sure to ALWAYS follow the rule \"Whatever you do to the bottom, you have to do to the top!\" and multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number!Always multiply or divide by the same number, otherwise your fractions will be different!

Therefore, 35 slices of the first pie would be less than 35 slices from the second pie!i don\\'t know15it is not because if it was the denominator would have to be larger than the number 24.your numerator is smaller, and your denominator is larger. so your denominator needs to be snaller and your numerator needs to be biiger than your denominator.next time you need to make sure that your numerator and denominator change is different.your numerator is smaller, and your denominator is larger. next time you need to make sure that your denominator is smaller, and you numerator is larger than you denominator.Next time you need to make your that your smallest number goes into both of your denominators.Next time you need to make sure that your largest number goes into both of your denominators.i dont knowi dont know but i know that is error was his product of both denominatorsNext time you need to make sure that your smallest number goes into both of your denominators.Next time you need to make sure that your largest number goes into both of your denominators.Next time you need to make sure that your smallest number goes into both of your denominators.Next time you need to make sure that your largest number goes into both of your denominators.That is incorrect because she added her denominators and your not supposed to do that.its is not because 45 is a smaller number than 65. 65 is a larger number than 45. so 32/45 is smaller than 32/65. 32/65 is not a smaller fraction than 32/45. everybody kows thatKia is wrong because you don`t add the denominators and in addition you are madding two numbers for one larger number. since 6/13 is smaller than 4/5 Kia is wrong.32/65 is 32 out of 65 and 32/45 is 32 out of 45.robert you should of did 9 times 2 and 6 times 2 and you would of got an equivalent fractionadison you should of done 5 times 2 and 7 times 2 and you would of got an equivalent fractionvannessa you snould of multipyed both numbers by 2raj you should of multiplyed both numbers by 2jamal you also should of multiplyed both numbers by 2victor youshould have multiplied your numbers by twomary you should of multiplyed by 2alexander you should have multiplied 6x5 and 10x3olivia you shuld have mltiplied 21x1 and 7x3katie you should of multiplied 12x2 and3x8ryan you should of multiplied 5 and 2 and 1 and 10matt yould have multipled 2x6 and 3x4brad you should have multiplied 16x1 and 8x2effie you should have done 9x5 and 15x3sall you should have multiplied 6x4 and 1x24lester you compared incorrectlyjimmy you multiplied wrong for 3 time 4kima you got an incorrect lcdshe is wrong because 7/9+3/4=1and19/3615/21 is 15 out of 21 and 15/24 is 15 out of 24I do not think that is right because demonitnators have to be the same add a fraction. That is what I thinkIt is smaller because 32 over 45 is only 13 apart . That is why 32 over 65 is smaller than 32 over 45.Six times two is 12 Nine times two is 18 so put the 12 on top and put 18 on the . then you get 12 18she needs to multply to get 30 and 5 times 6 equles 30She needs to multy 21 times 1 and is 21 and 7 times 3 is 21 .

Kia would have to make the demominators common, before subtracting.  The common denominator is 36, in this case, and you must multiply the numerators by 4 in this example, here\\'s what it should be.  28/36 -12/36= 16/36.15/21 is larger than 15/24 becuase when the demoninator is a smaller number the pieces are bigger.  When the demoninator is a lager number, the pieces are smaller.Our advice to you is to practice yout multiplication facts so you won\\'t get questions like these wrong.Don\\'t multiply the numerator and denominator by different numbers.Our advice is to multiply both the numerator and denominator by the same number.Multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number.Multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number.You need to get the smallest number that goes into each number that will work.You must find the least common denominator by multipling to get the same number for each denominator.You need to find the number 24 so you can find the least common denominator by finding the number combinations that go into each number.You must find the smallest number that will go into both numbers to find the least common denominator.You must find the smallest number that goes into both denominators.You must find the largest  number that goes into both denominators.You must find the smallest number that goes into each denominator.You must find the largest number that goes into both denominators.You must find out that the larger denominator is the larger fraction.To convert the fraction, the numerator must be added to.The LCD is the largest factor of both denominators.To convert the fraction, the numerator was added to.The larger denominator is the larger fraction.The LCD is the largest factor for both denominators.To convert the fraction, the numerator was added to.The larger denomininator is the larger fraction.Her answer isn\\'t correct because she would have to simplifie the fractions so it would be easier for her to add the fractions.Her answer isn\\'t correct because she would have to simplifie the fractions so it would be easier for her to add the fractions.  Here is whHer answer isn\\'t correct because she would have to simplifie the fractions so it would be easier for her to add the fractions.  Here is what it should look like,Her answer isn\\'t correct because she would have to simplifie the fractions so it would be easier for her to add the fractions.  Here is what it should look like, 10/40 + 24/40 = 34/40.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because if the denominator is larger, the pieces are smaller.i think it is wrong because the denominators are the samebecause 15 is closer to 21 than 24multaply the original numbers by 2he needs to multaply to 30she needs to know 21x1she has to give a  better multiplication anwser that is reson ablehe needs to find the smallest multapleit is wrong because the denominator would be 4032 is closer to 45 than 65I think Kia can show 7/9 3/4 and 4/5 because in the models above those fractions are shown. When you count how many parts are in each one that is the denominator when you see how many are colored in that is the numerator. That is how I know that Kia showed 7/9, 3/4, and 4/515/21 is larger than 15/24 because even though they each have the same amount shaded, in the one with 21 parts the parts would be bigger and have more room.He needs to learn how to do math right!change her answersPAY ATTENIONpay attion in classfix your glassesget it rightdouble ansertchange his anwser to the right one or ...look at the problems closlylearn the basicssomethingdo somthing other then multipleing211738hit the whip and make the numbers evensallyyyyy needs to divide morethe one the with the larger numerator is the largest when the denominator is the same.The number you multiply the denominator by is the same numbr you multiply the top or numerator by.you need to convert to the same denominator.When she multiplies the denominator and numerator she needs to make sure she does it by the same numbers.Kia has to get all the denominators to the same number so all the fractions are the same themn she can add the numorators of all the fractions together because the denominator stays the same when you add fractions.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because if you represented it in a square the square would have to be the same size for both fractions. You have to fit 65 pieces in one square and 45 in another. In the square with 45 pieces the pieces have more room so they are going to be bigger pieces than the 65.I think Kia is wrong because 8 and 5 meet at 40 so 8 times 5 = 40 and 5 times 8= 40 . Then 2 times 5= 10 and 4 times 8 =32I think Kia is wrong because 8 and 5 meet at 40 so 8 x 5 = 40 and 5 x 8= 40 . Then 2 x  5= 10 and 4 x 8 =32. 2/8 then becomes 10/40 and 4/5 becomes 32/40.  10/40 + 32/40=42/40 or 1 2/40 or 1 1/20 not 6/13.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because 65 takes up more space than 45 if you were to shade in blocks for those fractions.Robert,you must multiply by 2 for the numerator and the denomonator. You must not make the numerator smallerand the denomonator bigger.Allison,your mistake was,you multiplied 5x2=10 and then you did 7x3=21.Which should of been 10/14.you should of multiplied 10x2=14.you should read the directions more carefully..Venssa,your mistake was that you did not rea the directions and multiply 2x2=4.Alexander,you messwed up the problem by you multipling by 2 and that messed the whole problem up because you multiplied 2x10 and 6x2 and the numbers do not meet.Olivia,Your mistake was,you multiplied 3x1 and you got 3 and you where supposed to multiply 21x1=21=7x3.Kaitie,Your mistake was you multiplied 8 by 12 and got 96 and then multiplied 12 by 8 and got 96 when 24 was the real least common denomonator.Ryan, your mistake was, you mutiplied the wrong numbers.But the numbers should have been 5x2=10=1x10.Matt, your mistake was that you multiplied 4 x 2 =12 and 4 YOU SHOULD PAY ATTENTION.Lester,your mistake was you,multiplied by the wrong numbers it shold have been 72 as the denomonator and 45 and 40 as the numerator and should have been the less than sign.Jimmy, you mulitiplied  1x17 and 3 x6. You needed to multiply 1x5 and 3x4. Please pay attention.I think Kia should have found the least common denominator, 36. S0 28/36 - 27/36 = 1/36. Not 4/5.I think Kia should have found the least common denominator, 36. S0 28/36 - 27/36 = 1/36. Not 4/5. She should have paid better attention.15/21 is larger than 15/24 because if you find the least commom de15/21 is larger than 15/24 because if you find the least commom denominator,504, 360 is larger

that is equal to 3 times 10 is the same aswerWhen we put 7 it worked but the rest were wrong so we did 7 times 3 since 3 was already there and got 21 so that 21 was already there and we new that 21 times 1 is 21 so they would be equal.Lester did the larger denominator is the larger fraction.Jimmy did to convert the fraction, the numerator was added.Kima did the Idc is the largest factor for both denomitors.no can\\'t be a answer because the frations are no the same frationit is smaller because the denominator is smaller than the other denominaternoDear Alex,  next time you do fraction problem make sure your common denominator is in simplest form.Olivia, you should try to make sure you should see if your denominators can be multiplied by 1 and then try that :).Make sure you use  simplest form. :)Make sure you multiply the largest denominator by one.Make sure you make sure you are multiplying in simplest form.:)Nice try but try to make sure you are doing your math the right way.  :]Make sure you multiply the larger fraction by one.    ,\\' (You are not doing the right kind of fractions. You should be multiplying each denominator by each other. :)Make sure do the right kind of comparing D\\'Angeloi think she couldnt find a answer because the denumerator weren\\'t the same.I think that 32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because the larger the dunominator the smaller the fraction is.Dear Robert,Dear Alison,Dear VanessaDear RajDear JamalDear VictorDear marydear otisdear slexanderdea5 oliviacjmd fctujyRyan i feel like you need to pay more attention to what the teacher is saying... or you tell him/her that you are stuck. It could also mean that you are having some trouble with you multiplication. GOOD LUCK in math.Hi Matt it is okay if you are having some troubles. Matt try to stuy a little bit harder.Hi Brad on this problem i noticed you were using the wrong multiplication problems try to figure out what your doing.Effie your problem is wrong by ALOT. I\\'m not trying to hurt your feelings but your fractions and multiplication skills need some practice.

If you are dividing, you have to pick a number bigger than 1 and not 1 that divides into both the numerator and the denominator.To get the least common denominator you have to cross multiply. To cross multiply, you have to multiply the denominator of one fraction to the numerator of the other fraction.Since 21 is a big number, you keep it the same and then find out other numbers that divide into it.To find the least common denominator you have to find the smallest number that divides into both denominators.You have to multiply one denominator to the other one with the smallest number possible other than 1.If you cross multiply, you will see how the 2 fractions are bigger and smaller than each other.To get the problem correct, you have to multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number.To get the problem correct, you should have the same denominator for both fractions.I think she is right because 2+4=6 and 8+5=13.If you cross multiply 65 times 32 you get 315 then you multiply 45 times 32 to get 225. Then you see 315 is bigger than 225.incorrect,incorrect,incorrect i do not agreebecause you want 21 big peicesyou need to get smarteryou need to get smarteryou need to get smarteryou need to get smarteryou need to get smarteryou need to get smaaryteryou need to get smarteryou need to get smarteryou need to be smarteryou need to get smarteryou need to get smarteryou need to get smarteryou need to get smarteryou are really smartyou are smartyou did ok  we just had some adjustmentsyou are a hersheys cookies and creamyou need to get smarteryou needNo, because you can\\'t change the denometer.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because the numarater is the same and the denometer is smaller which mean the peices are bigger.Robert should make sure when he doubles the fractions that he multiplies by two or doubling correctly so that the fractions are equal.He does not have to always multiply the numerater by the denominator on both fractions to try to find the least common denominator.She switched the 7 and the 1 around. So if she did  that ithey would have two different products.She did find a denominator that fits into both fraction but it isn\\'t the least common denominator because it is not the smallest number possible that is the product of both denominators.He did not find the smallest number that is able to be product of both numbers.Since 5/8 is bigger than 5/9 the numerater of 5/8  is bigger than the numerater for 5/9when findingashe shouldn\\'t add the denominator to the equal fractionm15/21 is bigger than 15/24 because if they have the same numerater than the fraction with the smaller denomenater is bigger.i think she is right. i think this because you can use diagrams to explain or show things.it is larger beacause 15 is closer to 21 than 15 to 24.he needs to do 6 times 2=12. then he needs to do 9 times 2=187 times 2 = 142 times 2 = 44+4=8. 5+5=103+3=6. 1+1=23+3=62+2=4. 7+7=148+8=16.6 and 5 go into 3021 and 3 go into 2112 and 8 both go into 245 and 10 both go into 106 and 4 go into 128 and 16 both go into 1615 and 9 both go into 454 and 24 both go into 245/8 is biger12/20 is bigger8 is the denominator12 is the denominator4/5 bigger18 is the denominator3/4 is bigger2/5 is biggerI think that she is right because an image is something to help you vizualize something so she is right.It is smaller because 32 is closer to 45 than 32 to 65.I think she is right because all of her denominators are the same as her writing and all of her numorators are also the same as her writing.the smaller the denominator the bigger the peiceIDKshe just needed to dubble her answershe needed to dubble her answerhe needs to add rightI do not knowI D KYOU NEED TO PUT IN THE RITE ANSWERI D KIDKhe needs to get the answers ritechech her workleslie needs to chech her workshe needs to change one of her answersIDK\\\\ask for help next timeIDK                                            IDKi thjnk she did it wrong B/C she pretty much just made it up5the bigger the denomanator the smaller the pieceNo because she just subtracted the numbers across but what she should have done is find the least common denominator then subtracted the numernators in the new fractionsBeacuse if you find the least common denominotor and multiply the numbers the first fraction will be biggerhe needs to know to use the same operation on the numerator and denomatorYou have to multipy by the same numberyou have to double the numberhe should pick something that divides into the demonator evenlyshe should not multipy by a number that will make it hugeshe needed to find a smaller numberHe needs to find a smaller numberhe needs to  mltiply correctlyhe needs to find a smaller multipleHe cant judge a fractions by the denomatorhe needs to know the bigger numerator is bigger when the denomators are the sameshe needs to look for the least common denominatorshe needs to look for the least commen denomatorshe needs to covert correctlyHe needs to find a least commen demonatorShe needs to find a commen demonator for bothshe needs to multpily correctlyhe needs to know which fraction is greaterNo because she didnt find the least common denominator and she just added up the denominatorsBecause when you find the leastcommon denominator for 65 and 45, 32 over 65 will be smallerKia is wrong, first you have to find a denominator for both of the fractions. Then you add. My answer is 1/36.If the denominator is smaller, then the object is cut into smaller peaces. But if the numerator is bigger, then thats how many parts of the denominator you haveIf the denominator is smaller, then the object is cut into smaller peaces. But if the numerator is bigger, then thats how many parts of the denominator you have. 15 is 15 but 21 is less than 24 so 15/21 i larger than 15/24If the denominator is smaller, then the object is cut into smaller peaces. But if the numerator is bigger, then thats how many parts of the denominator you have. 15 is 15 but 21 is less than 24 so 15/21 i larger than 15/24.be smarterdont just gess, trysymplyfyhey sirhey , take your timetry hardertry harderTry hardertry hardertry hardertry hardertry hardertry hardertry hardertry hardertry harderKia is wrong, you first have to find the least comon denominater for the two fractions. Then you have to multiply the numerator to what you multiplyed for your least comon denominator. Then just add. I got 42/40, wich is 1 1/10.if the denominator isbigger than the other denominator. it means that the object is split into smaller piesesif the denominator isbigger than the other denominator. it means that the object is split into smaller pieces.I think the answer is 14/18 because 7+3+4=14. If you add them all together it would equal 18. Thats how I got 14/18.It is larger than 15/24 because if you have 15/24 of somthing it  would be less than. If you had 15/21 of somtthing you would have greater than.He was supposed to multiply by 2she should have multiplied both number by 2She should have multiplied both numbers by 2She should have multiplied both numbers by 2She should have multiplied both numbers by 2She should of multiplied by 2She should have multipplied by 2she shoul have multiplied by 2change the 3 to a 5change 3 to 21change 12 to 24change 5 to 10change 4 to 12change 8 to 16change 9 to 45change 4 to 24change nothingchange nothingngchange 1/2 to 4/8change everthingI think the answer is 8/4032/65 is smaller than 32/45 because if you have 32/65 of somthing it is smaller.I dont knowBecuase 24 is divided into more pieces and 21 is less than 24 and more is shaded.He has to double the number to get it to equal the first fraction so 6+6=12 thats how I got my  numerator number.Also 9+9=18 thats how I got my denominator??????waaaaaaaahhhhhhhh This is too hardwell um I know that the 12 *2=24 but I don\\'t know how she got the three or the eightI can seee how you got the 10 and the 5 butt your supposed to do five times two equals 10 and multiply it by one then it will give you ten becuase anything times one will give you that numberI am not surethe smallest fraction is allways going to be the biger one because it is split into more pieces but the least fraction will allways be the largest because it is split into more pieces butt other wise you got every thing right good job.I\\'m sorry this one is hard I am not sureUse the \\'\\'hint\\'\\' thingyI imagined the 12 is split up into 4 pieces and the 3*4 =12 so first I trisd the 4 it didn\\'t work so there was only one number lft that I could do so that is how I got the first fraction and the second one is too hard too explain and I can\\'t really undersnot sure how you got that but nice tryNEVER ADD THE DENOMINATORS!!!!!!!!!NEVER ADD THE DENOMINATORS!!!!!!!!! other wise you got it all right 2+4=6 and that is right but just remember that       YOU CAN NOT ADD THE DENOMINATORS NEVER EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Good job besides thatthe biggist denominator is always goinng too be split up into more parts so that is why there will have too be more shadede in  so 45 in fractions would be greater than 65 that is why it is smaller than      45I Think her awnser is right because for the first fraction it is 2 and 8 and then the next fraction is 4 out of 5 then the last fraction is 6 of 13 and the fractions match the pictures that she madeIt is smaller because i did cross mutaiply and 65 times 32 and it is 2080when he gets to the fraction 12 over 18 then he just would need 6 more to get to 18he needs to mutiply each donominators each of the same numberhe needs to mutpiy 7 3 times to get to 21if you know 12 x 2 = 24 then try 12 x 3 then see what comes out of thatso 5 x 2 = 10 then 10 x 1 = 10 because anything times 1 = its selfif 6 x 2 = 12 then if you do 6 x 3 and that is 18 so anything you muiptly just add that number to the one you already have!if you mutiply both denominators each by the same number then maybe you would come out the right awnsersWill she will need to see the denominator and see if the numbers can mutiply into each other and if they can then she is goodif sally didn\\'t do that then she would of did it wrong and that will be bad so you would need to find the common denominators and when she does that then she will have the right awnserhe will need to figer out the fractions and then see what is the greater fraction then he will do more than or less thanwill jimmy, he will need to see how many bars there are ad thne muitply to get the righ anwser for the less thankima will need to find the dot and see where it is at than see if it is less than or greater thansence there is a 12 at the bottom than that will mean that there will be a three because  3 goes into 12 with no remainder.The denomantor is the bigger number and both of the denomantor are 35. They are both 35 because 5 goes into 353 goes into 6 and 9 can go into 18 once and 4 can into 12 3 times and 6 can go into 3 timesI think she can do that because all of them are the same as the fractionit is biger because the prenstage is biggerKia is wrong because 2/8 + 4/5 = 1 and 2/40 not 6/13.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because 65 is bigger than 45 so in fracions ha means it is smallerThe correct steps for solving this problem are to do 10 times 3 and 6 times 5 to get 30the correct steps for this problem are to do 7 times 3 and 21 times 1 to get 21the correct steps for sovling this problem are to do 8 times 3 and 12 times 2 to get 24the correct steps for this problem are to do 10 times 1 and 5 times 2 to get 10To get the correct answer matt needs to do 6 times 2 and 4 times 3To get the correct answer Brad needs to do 1 times 16 and 8 times 2To get the answer correct you need to do 5 times 9 and 15 times 3the correct steps for solving this problem are to do 4 times 6 and 1 times 24the steps for solving the problem are to do 5 times 9 and 5 times 8jimmy needs to do 1 times 5 and 3 times 4To get the problem correct you need to doTo get the problem correct  she needs to do 3 timesD\\'angelo needs to do 4 times 7 and 4 times 5anne has to do 4 times 3 and 3 times 2Donna needs to do 3 times 6 and 3 times 4omar needs to do 2 times 5 and 2 times 8es 8i think kia is wrong because the least common demoninator is 36, not 515/21 is larger than 15/24 because which ever denomenator is smaller is the bigger oneI think that Kia is correct because 8 + 5 =13 and 2+4=6 13 is on the bottem and 6 is on the top and she showed the correct workI know that the nmerater is how many you shade inRobert did not multiply correectlyrobert did not mutipliy croletlyyou did not times by 2 in the second one you did times by 3 thoutyou did not times the numerator corrdtyyou did good equivelent fractions but next time try better on cmparing fractionsI think that you are correctbecause the smaller the denominator the bigger spaces to colorno she is wrong because you should never subtract the denominator. Youhave to make them like denominators.It should be 1/1215/24 is larger than 15/21 because 15 is to 24 than it is to 21.15/21 is larger than 15/24 because15/21 is larger than 15/24 because 15 is closer to 21 than 24.First write out all the product that 6 makes. Then write all the products ten makes and compare them which everone matches the other that is your least common denominatorYou need to make sure your numbers are all in the right spotsShe  needs to make sure she is finding the least comon denominator not the great common denomminatorFind the Least Common Denominator to find the  denominator . Then multiply the number that you used to get your least common denominator.He needs to make sure thAT HE IS MULTIPLYING the same number for numorator and denominatorNo because she added the denominator and you NEVER ADD THE DENOMINATOR!!!Yes that is true because 32 is closer to 45 than 65I agree with Kia because her statement is true.151515/21 reduces to a larger equivelent fraction than 15/24add another set of that number or multiply by 2find the least commond denominator or lcdfind the least common denominator or lcdshe needs to find the least common denominatorshe needs to find the least common denominatorfind the least common denominatorfind the least common denominatorthink about the common denominatorhe needs to think about the least common denominatorlook at the denominatorslook at the denominatorslook at the denominatorslook at the denominatorlook at the denominatori think that Kia is rightbecause when tou give them the same denominator  32/65 is smalleryessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssmugutgnrhiyshe have to fine a fraction thats equalgo8rtfp97yregf9ty54-er97tr9ey9f[7he had to times by the same numberI dont know/IDKITS NOTkia is wronge because when you use the picture your brain might thing subtract everything,when you actually need to find the real answer by finding a common denominator by finding a multiple of the 9 and the 4 that are the same then subtrct that and simplify you see 9 times 4 is 36 and 4 times 9=36. 7 times 4 is 28 and thats your numerator for 28 over 34 than you have 3 times 9 which is 27 so thats your numerator for 27 over 34. after that you subtract 28 over 34 to 27 over 34=1 over 34 than you check to make sure you can or can\\'t simplify the number. you can not subtract 1 over 34 because 1 can not be divided15 over 21 is larger than 15 over 24 because lets sayyou have a large pizza that cut it into 24 peices there are more peices than if you cut it into 21 slices.the probem is if you cut it into 24 slices the peice have to be smaller,but if you cut the pizza into 21 slics the pieces can be bigger like how the fraction 1 over 21 is larger than the fraction 15 over 24Make sure to multipliy the denominator and the numeraternext time dont always change to denomanatornext time find other numbers instead of just multiplyingNEXT TIME TRY TO FIND THE LOWEST NUMBERNEXT TIME FIND LEAST COMMON DENOMANATORNEXT TIME TRY TO CHANGE ONLY ONE NUMBERNEXT TIME FIND A NUMBER THAT THEY CAN GO INTONEXT TIME FIND A NUMBER THAT THEY CAN GO INTOONLY CHANGE ONE NUMBERi think she is right because if you just added them without simplifing it would be rightbecause the bigger the denominator the smaller the numerator is as a fraction of the denominatormy name is jeffdouble itmultiply it by twouse a calculator......it is not a testCCCCAAAAALLLLLLCCUUUULAAATTTOOOOOORRRRRRcalculatoryou need an example, like if you split a circle into 3rds  1 3rd is smaller than 2 3rdsyou have to multiply the numerator by the same number as the denominatoryou have to see what is the lowest you can multiply by to get equivalent denominators then multiply the numerator by the same number as the denominatormultiply the numerator by the same number as the denominatorYOU PLAYED YOURSELFPLAYED.

GO BACK TO FIRST GRADE!!YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS NEED TO LEARN YOUR MATH!!!She is showing the fractions in pictures andd subtracting them in pictures.if u multyply it by the other number u will see that 15/21 is larger than 15/24no because there is one number left of the first fractionbecause the lower denomenater the bigger graphbecause the lower denomenater the bigger graph with less linesHe needs to make the same changes with numerators and denominators.do the math rightShe has to make the same problem for both of the numerator and denominatorShe made an unquivelnt problem with the denominatorHe didn\\'t equal the same thing for both.He just doesed offfShe multiplied in differences with the answerShe multipliedplied differentlyHe didn\\' equal the same 6thing.He needs to make the same answer.She needs the same denominator.He multiplied rongly yabba dabba doo.He did math rongery.He multiplied differently.I think the answer should be 33/40.I think this because 8*5I think the answer should be 33/40.I think this because 8*5=40 so the denominators are both fortyI think the answer should be 33/40.I think this because 8*5=40 so the denominators are both forty.. THE numerator is a good guessYou bring the denominators to the same amount and one should be biggger.I think that all of the fractions are equalavlant to each other because if you line the fraction blocks you will see the are equal to each other.I think it is larger because the denominator is not cut into smaller pieces because the denominator in 15 over 21 21 is is not cut up in as many peices as 24 as the denominator.she should look at the fractions that are shaded then she should count the shaded fractions and get 2 as the numerator and get 7 as the  denomintorwe multiplyed by 2 because, the fraction circie to the right was cut up into 27 and 2 were shaded so, we multiplyed the numerator and denominator by 2I muiltiply by 2 because they are ready muiltyply by 2 in 5 times 2 so idid the same thing on the denominatori knew that the denominator is muiltiply by 2 so did it to the numinator it is 2 times 2 =4every answer was correct but her greater and less symol was wrong. She said that the the fraction on the bottom was less but she was wrong it was greater thanjimmyHer example shows 6 as her Numerator and 7as her Denominator but her answer is 6 thirdteensths she should have 6 sevensthsit is smaller because it is cut up into more peicesi think she is rong because the common dinominator is 40 and the answer is 42 over 40 wich is a improper fractionI think she is rong because the common dinominator is 40 and the answer is 42 over 40 wich is a improper fraction.IT IS SMALLKER BECAUSE 32 IS CLOSER TO 45 THAN 65.you should always double check your work to make sure it is always rightyou should always double check your work to make sure its rightyou should always double check your work to make sure its rightyou should always double check your work to make sure it is correctyou should always double check your work to make sure its rightyou should always double check your work to make sure it is correctyou should always double check your work to make sure your anwsers correctyou should always double check your anwsers to make sure there correctyou ahould always double check your answer to make sure its correctyou should always double check your anwser to make sure its correctyou should always double check your work to male sure its rightyou should always double check your work to make sure its correctyou should always double check your work to make sure its correctyou should always double check your work to make sure your answer is correctyou should always double check your anwsers to make sure they are correctyou should always double check your work to make sure its correctyou should always double check your work to make sure its correcti think that she did her work correctit is larger because it is biggrrI think it is wrong because she didn\\'t find the least common demonitor for the two fractions which made her answer incorrect.If you use a model and brake it into pieces you will find that whenyou brake up the model into 21 pieces and the other model into 24 for pieces the model wiIf you use a model and brake it into pieces you will find that when you brake up the model into 21 pieces and the other model into 24 pieces the model with 21 pieces will have greater space in each piece which makes it greater.He has to multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2to find least common denominator you need to find the smallest number that goes into both denominatorsto find least common denominator you have to find the smallest number that goes into both of the fractions when you multiply to find the least common denominator.When finding least common denominator you cant multiply both denomiators together you have to find a number that both deminators go into  equally and it has to be the same number that both go into.when finding the largest fraction you cant compare the denominators and just think if the denominater is greater the fraction is greater. You havwhen finding lcd you have to multiply the numerator by the same number that you multiplied for the denominatorwhen finding lcd you have to find the smallest number that goes into both denominatrs equally and it cant be less than any of the denominators.I think its wrong because she didnt find the least common denominator.If you have a model and brakeIf you have a model and brake it into 65 and 45 parts you will find that the model with 65 parts will have a smaller area in each piece.multiply the nomerator and denominator by the same whole number.multiply the denominator and numerator by the same whole number.multiply the denominator and numerator by the same whole number.on a line plot you have to add more tic marks of how many are there then move the dot how many you moved it forward.do not add but multiply or divide a fraction to get an equivalent fractionDo not add 2 multiply or divide by 2look for the least common denominator in both frations and not just onelook for the least common denominator in both frations and not just onemake sure you put the numbers in the correct placemake sure it is the smallest multiple for the denominatorsmake sure it is the smallest amount of denominatorsdont divide the denominators multiplyyou have to multiply both denominatorsdont mix up the answers for the LCDmultiply all of the denominators and not just oneit would equal one wholethe bigger the denominator gets the smaller the fraction getslook at the denominators and see if they have a multible in commonlook at the denominators do they both have a common nultiblelook at the denominators  and see if they have a common multiblelook at the denominator and see if they have a commmon multiblelook at the denominator and see if they have a common multibletimes the denominator then miultiple the numerator with the same numberlook at the fraction and see if it is right dont do anything if not look at the numerator and multipleyou got to make the denominators the samethe first fraction the numbers are closer to each other so the second friction is biggerkia cant because you cant add with diffrent denominators .i konw that the smaller the denominator the smaller the fraction .I also know 65 is bigger than 45 and those are the denominators.er 36.I know that if you mulitply the numerrator and denominator by the same number you will get an ecuvilent farcson.For example 5 times 2 = 10 and 10 will be the numerrator and 7 times 2 = 14 and 14 will be the denominator. Thisis how i know that Alison is wr good and by the way the fraction is 15 over 21 the endI know that 2 times 2 =4 and 8thies 2 =16 so i put 4 in the numerator box and 16 in the denominator box. i know this becuse if you mulitpy the numerator and the denominator by the same number. this i how i know that Vanessa made a mastac.i know that the bigger the denominater the smaller the fraction or piece so i know that the fractions are correct because of the way i know thati know that when you are making a eculivent fraction you have  to mulitply  the numerator and denominator by the same number to get the right answer . for example i know i was right because i did the right melid to get the answer.i think  you haveto make all of the fracins the same number because you can subtract the fraction enless all thae fractions have the smae denominator.I know that the samller the denomintor the smallerthe fraction or peace .she is correct bescause seven are shaded on one and three are shaed on the oter one and four are shaed on te other one.15/21 is bigger than 15/24 beacaue the tops are both 15 and one is 21 and24 so the bigger one is the one  with the smaller denominater.just grow the fraction so that means mutliply the fraction by twojust multipe the fraction by twou just have to multipy the fraction by twou just have to multiply by 2you just  have to multipy it by 2double itall you have to do is multipy it by 2learn to multiply by2you just have to multiply by 6 and 5all you have to do is multiplyall you have to do is multiplymultiplyall you do is multiplyuse your braninall you have to do is multiplylean to multiplyyou just have to make lcm of 72all you have to do is find a lcmfind the lcmfind the lcmall you have to do is find the lcmfind lcmfind lcmfind lcmno because she nover found the lcm and you can not just add you will get the wrong answerbecause the donominater is smallerIt is right because 7-3=4it is not because 21 is less than 24There is no 27 th in the fractions.She can get the problem right by getting the fraction.He needs to multiply correctly.She just needed to swich 7 and 196 is the wrong number she should put 24.he needs to not give the least common a bigger number.He thought that 5/9 was less than 5/8Jimmy mutipiled incorretly it is 12/20 and 5/20she needs to do the faction rightshe needs to get the fraction rightNo because you do not add the denoantor just the numantor !It is not because 65 is larger than 45KIA added the numerator and demnominator. You are not supposed to do that when you are adding fractions.32/65 is smaller because it has a bigger denominator and the same numerator.Change with the same number,Multiply with the same number!use the correct combanation!He needs to get the right answer next time he gets a question like that beacause he now knows what to do now,He needs to do it correctly cause he gott it wrongShe needs to get right the question next timeshe needs to get right for the next answerHe needs to get it correct next time.HE SUBTRACTED ALL OF THE FRACTIONS AND YOU CANT DO THAT. THAT IS WHAT HIS ERROR WAS IN THAT SUBTRACTION OF FRACTIONS QUESTION.The numerators are the same but the denominator is smallerNo because the smallest number that goes into eight  and five is 40/fourty32/65 is smaller because the 65 spaces are tinier than 45 spaces in the same amount of room.You need to read the directions more carefully.you tripled the the denominator when you were supposed to double ityou only doubled the denominator not the numeratoryou added three and didn\\'t multiply by twoyou added two and did not multiply by twoyou need to read the directions more carefully.five doesn\\'t go into two so that can not be the answertwenty one times anything will willnot go into threeyou multiplied the denominators by  each otheryou multiplied the denominatorsby each otherthree and one don\\'t go into tworead the directionsread the directionsno because to subtract them they need to have the same denominators15/21 is larger than 15/24 becausethe smaller the denominator in the same amount of space of the bigger denominator gives the smaller denominator more roomso the spaces are bigger.no because you have to common denomatorsit is larger because the dnator is smallerrobert needs to muliply or dividemake sure the least common denomenator is the same.kobeshe needs to mulplyfind the largest #mulymulplyfind lcdfind icdcurryshe dosent have common denometersit is smaller because the denometer is not the sameMake sure you are remembering the parts of a fraction and that the numorator is on top and the denomonator is on the bottom.Make sure you are doing the multiplacation right.make sure your multiplacation is rightMake sure you are putting in enough numbers for both denomonators to go into.make sure you are putting your numbers in the right place.Make sure you are doing the smallest product.Make sure you are doing the smallest product.I think kia is incorrectI think 15/21 is greater because the denominator 21 is less than 24 and the numerators are both 15. when the denominator is less than the other denominator it shoe up on a whole a bigger section than 15/24Her picture shows 12 shaded but her probelm does not. and 14 not shaded, so therefore the probelm does not make sense.It is smaller because it is a bigger number than the other one.So in fractions that makes sense that.You need to remember your math facts and try to study hardAlison has to remember her math facts to get the answer.He needs to under fractions better so he could get all the answers right.Also he needs to make sure his perdictions for his answer makes sense.Then he would have all the answers correct.I think that she knows what she is doing.And she truely understand fractions.That fraction is larger because in fractions that would be considered.she showed all the right fractions up abovethe denominator is smallerHe needs to learn how to do math right!change her answersPAY ATTENIONpay attion in classfix your glassesget it rightdouble ansertchange his anwser to the right one or ...look at the problems closlylearn the basicssomethingdo somthing other then multipleing211738hit the whip and make the numbers evensallyyyyy needs to divide moreshe needs to count her first onethe denominator is smalleri think that is incorrect beacause you dont subtract denominatorsif you have the same numerator with different denominators the smaller denomiator will be more because the one with the smaller denominator will have a bigger peicetry to be carful with your mutiplying,and go with smaller numbers!:)pay attentoin to your mutipying and study more!:)foucus on what your doing and study more!:)next time multiply not add!:)multiply not addnext time multiply ALL your numbers!:)next time multiply!:)try to study more!:)study morestudy more!:)try to study more!!!:)i have trouble on least common denominators to try to study more!!!!!!:)try to study more!!!!!!:)the smaller number is the larger denominator!:)watch your mutiplucation and your number signs!:)watch your icd s !:)watch your number signs!:)the smaller denominators are larger!:)I think it  is incorrect because she added the denominators.

In whole numbers 65 is bigger then 45 ,but in fractions it is smaller because 65 has more parts to it. 45 however is bigger because it has less partsAlexander needs to be more careful about how he does his work and check his work before he turns it in because he made a big error in this problem.Olivia needs to check her work before she finishes her problem. She didnt put the denominator in the middle and the multiple for the denominators were switched.make sure to check your work before you turn it in because you could do the problem correct but you could make a computation errorYou do not have to multiply both of the denominators for you can get the smaller denominator an have to reduce more.When you are comparing fractions the number with the larger denominator is smaller.  Make sure you check your work next time to prevent making this mistake again. Other than that mistake or error your work was excellent!Jimmy needs to rember  to mutiply the numerator.Also he needs to check his work for any errors because he could do the problem correct but make a small errorKima you need to have the LCD be the smallest  number that the denominators (that are already there) can go into. Please check your work thourghly.Don\\'t add the numerator or the denominator because otherwise you will get the wrong answer also because you have to multiplyI thinkt hat Kia is is incorrect.Because when i did it I got a differnt answer15/21 is bigger than 15/24 because 21 is less than 24 and sine itis less it has less parts which makes it biggerI believe that Kia is incorrect because I first made both fractions have equal denominators then I got 28/36 and 27/36 so 4/5 is greater than 5/20.You need to read the directions more carefully because you have to double it. That means you multiply by 2Alison you need to check your work because on the denominator you multiplyed  by 3 but it should be 2.None of the multiplation problems equaled one.Olivia is thinking of dividing instead of multiplying.You were  thkining of the product of both denominators.Lester you need tolook at the numbers more carefully and also look at the modles.Jimmy you need to multiply the by the same number for both the numerator and denominatorKima you did the laradest factor for both so be a little more carefully.Leslie you addled the numeraors instead of multiplyingKia needs to change the the denominator  to the least lowest common denominator.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because if you change the denominator so they equal each other you get 32/65 is smaller than 32/45.That answer is not correct because you never change the denominator unless you are using two different denominators. If you are using two different denominators you go to a similar denominator then keep that denominator for the answer.It is larger becauseIt is larger because of the denominators. The numerators are the same so we don\\'t need to talk about that. 15/21 is larger than 15/24 because 24 is a bigger number than 21. In a fraction, if the denominator is bigger than it has smaller peices because you cut the fraction into smaller peices than the other. Since 24 is bigger than 21 it means that 24 is smaller than 21.Robert needs to double the numerator and the denomantor when he is finding a double fration. If he he had 6/9 he would the numerator and the denomantor to find his answer!Alison needs to multiply the numerator and denominator by 2 to get the double fraction which is her answer.When Vanessa double the denominator on her number line answer, but she divided by two on her numerator number. She would need to multiply both.Raj added three to each instead of multiplying by two.Jamal added 2 to each instead of multipling by 2.Jamal added 2 to each instead of multipling by 2.Alexander should try to multiply the denominators by one number that will give hime the same product. If it is the smallest number they both go into that will be the least commom denominator.Olivia should try to find the smallest number they both go into. If she does this, she will have found her least common denominators.Kaitie needs to use the smallest least common denominator not the biggest. :)Ryan multiplied both denominators together to get a big common denominators instead of the smallest.He should have put 6 x 2 =  12  = 3 x 4Brad should have got the least common denomanator 16 by multipling 8 by 2 and 16 by 1.Effie should have put 15 x 3 = 45 = 5 x 9Lester had to multiply the numerator by what he multiplied the denominator.Jimmy had to multiply what he had multiplied for the denominator.Kima did not use the same denominator. Instead she used two different ones.Leslie multiplied the denominator differently from her numerator.D\\'Angelo should have looked at the numorator when they had the same denominator instead of the original denominator.Anne had to make the same denominator, but instead didn\\'t.Kia changed the deonominator when she shouldn\\'t have. She shouldn\\'t have changed the denominator because the denominator never changes. It is like their name. If you are adding two different denominators, you should find a common denominator instead of adding the denominators. When you find a common denominator you multiply. Her answer should have been 10/40 + 32/40 =  1 2/40.Since the numerators are the same we can put them aside. 65 is smaller than 45 because in fractions it is basicly how many peices you divide them into. 65 is more peices than 45.Kia answer is incorrect because you have to find a least comman denominator. Her comman denominator would be 40 so she would transfer her fractions to have he least comman denominator and her anser would be 1 and 1/20.The reason why 32/65 is smaller than 32/45 is that the denominator is smaller so 32/45 is bigger.Robert make sure what ever you do to the bottom you have to do to the topAlison what ever you do to the bottom you have to do to the topAlexander to make sure you get the answer right you have to find a number that goes into both the numerator and denominator.Olivia to insure you get the right answer you want to find that if the smaller fraction can go into the bigger fraction then you can leave the fraction the same and change just the smaller fraction to match.Kaitieto make sure that you get the right answer see if there is the smallest number that both numbers can go into even if there different numbersRyan if you wnt to find the correct answer than always see if there is one number that can go into the other even if that means having different numbers to find the least comman denominaorMatt to get the right answer you need to look at the fractions to find the least comman denominatorTo get te right answeryou need to find the least comman denominatorYou always neeed to look beyond numoator times denominatorAlways find the least comman denominatorLester to insure that you get the right answer you always neeed to find the least comman denominator and that way you know which fraction is biggerJimmy to get the right answer you need to learn what ever you do to the bottom you have to do to the topmake sure that if you see that the fraction can go in to the denominator then you find the least comman denominatormake sure that in afraction whatever you do to the bottom you have to do to the topmake sure you compare the fraction right so that you get the right answermake sure that both fractions have that same ldc so you can copare themmake sure whatever you do to the bottom you have todo to the topmake sure you compare the fraction using the least comman denominatorTHis is incorrect because  you have to find the least comman denominator15/21 is larger than 15/24 because the smaller number is bigger than the larger denominator and to figure out if it is larger than find a least comman denominatorgi think that she is righ becuse she showed the equstinit is smaller becuase the deomtore 65 is bigger than 45he needs to read directions and times it by 2 to get his awnserehe needs to double the numbers to get his correct awnsrelisten to directionsdirectionsbutdes nutsbecause the have the same numater but the diff denomaterrreNo, because when I rounded the denominators to the equivalent denominator and did the same with the numerator and add 140/180 with 135/180 I get 275/180 and that is bigger than 144/180.When 15/21 and 15/24 have their denominators converted to the common denominator and the same with the numerators, 15/21 is 360/504 and 15/24 is converted to 315/504. 360/504 is larger than 315/504.Robert, you should (a) always check your work before submitting your final answer. (b) When making equivelent fractions, always multiply the denominator AND the numerator. However, you DIVIDED the numerator by 3 and mulpitlied the denominator by 3. You must do the same operation on the denominator and numerator.Alison, when making equivelent fractions, you must multiply or divide the numerator AND denominator by the same number.Venessa, if you are making equivelent fractions, you multiply the denominator and numerator by the same number. You divided the numerator instead of multiply.Alexander, you must make the denominators equal by listing multiples until denominators equal.Olivia, the denominators always must be equal.Kaitie, you want the denominator to be the smallest possible. To do that, list the multiples of each denominator until you find the lowest commen denominator number...Ryan, your denominators should be as small as possible. List the multiples until you get the smallest possible deno0minator.Matt, remember denominators must ALWAYS, i repeat  ALWAYS make the denominators equal. List the multiples until you get the smallest possible denominators.Brad,  the denominators should be THE SAME. List the multiples until you have the smallest possible denominator.Lester, the bigger the numerator the bigger the fraction, unlike the bigger the denominator, the smaller the fraction. Also, you used the incorrect symbol.Jimmy multiply the numerator AND denominator by the same number.KIma,the denominators must be the same, so you dint multiply the denominators OOOORRRR numerator by the same number.Leslie, you didnt correctly multiply. Multiply denominator and numerator by the same number.D\\'Angelo, you used the incorect symbol. Otherwise, your work is good.D\\'Angelo, you used the incorect symbol. Otherwise, your work is good.I think that she is wrong because 4/5 is bigger than 6/13.  You can\\'t  add something larger than the sum.  Kia should have converted 2/8 and 4/5 in to 10/40 and 32/40 then add it to get 42/40 or 1 2/40.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because the numerators are the same so you have to look at the denominators the smaller the denominator is the bigger the fraction is ,in this case the 45 is the sm32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because the numerators are the same so you have to look at the denominators the smaller the denominator is the bigger the fraction is ,in this case the 45 is the smaller denominator.  So 32/45 is larger than 32/65 or 32/65 is smaller than 32/45.You need to look  at the directions and followthem in order to get A CORRECT ANSWER!You need to do the same thing to the bottom as the top.YOU NEED TO FOLLOW DIRCETIONS VANESSAYOU NEED TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS RAJ.Jamal, you need to FOLLOW DIRECTIONS.Victor, you need to  fOLLOW THE STINKIN DIRECTIONS.PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU ARE WRITING!!!!BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WRITEYOU NEED TO WATCH WHAT YOU WRITE KATIEMake sure to check what you writeMake sure you check your work!Make sure you check your work!Make sure you check your work!Make sure you check your work!Don\\'t put the number with the larger denominator , see which one is greater firstDo not just add the  numerator!PAY ATTENTION KIMAMake sure you are mulipling correctly!Don\\'t always pick the larger denominatorPay attention!Pay attentionHer answer is all wrong. She just added the numerators and denominators together. The real answer is 1 and 2/40 or 1 and 1/20.32/65 is lesser than 32/45 because 45 is smaller than 65 and in fractions 45 is larger than 65.she cloud add some work to show ware she got it.the smaller

fractionI think she is correct because 4 plus 2 equals 6 and 8 plus 5 eqauls 13, so the answer is 6/13.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because the more fraction it is the more smaller it gets and takes up more space than 32/45 so 32/45 is smaller than 32/45.he had to double the numerators and the denominators numbersshe had to double the numinators and the denominators number.she had to double the

She should\\'ve converted the fractions to something they\\'re both equivilent to. Somthing like converting 2/8 to 10/40 and converting 4/5 to 48/40. Then converting the fractions to their simplest form and adding those to get 29/20.next time he needs to double it instead of triple it.double the denomonator instead of trippling it. the numorator was correct. She doubled it.double the numonator and don\\'t subtract one.make sure the denomonator goes into the least commen denomonator evenly.make sure the deomonator goes into the least commen denomonator.next time kaitie needs to make sure that the least common denominator is the product is both of the denominaters.Make sure the denomonator equales the least commen dewnomonator.the denominators both have to be \"related\". inthis case they\\'re both \"related\" to 10 so it\\'s correct.Make sure the denomonator equales the least commen denomonator.Make sure the denomonator equales the least commen denomonator.You have to make sure that both of the denomonators equal the least commen denomonator. You will know if you multiply the denomonators by a number and you get the same answer for both.next time lester needs to make sure that he knows that just because there is a the larger denominator doesnt mean that its the greatest fractionJimmy needs to make sure that both denomonators have the least commen denomonatora.Kima needs to make sure both denomonators go into the smallest commen denomonator.Leslie needs ton make sure that the denomonators equal the same loest commen denpomonator.I think the correct answer should be 1/36. To find this answer, I first found a denominI think the correct answer should be 1/36. To find this answer, I first found a denominator they both go into, 36. Then I multiplied the numinator 7 by 4 and the numinator 3 by 9. When I got the fractions 28/36 and 27/36, I subtracted them and got 1/36.I drew a pictureyes32 is farther away from 65 and 32 is closer to 45check your workchek your workckek your workchek your workchek your workchek your workchek your workchek your workchek your workchek your workchek your yourNo because you need to show what the least common denominator is.15/21 is bigger than 15/24 because 21 is smaller than 24.multiply the numerator and demoninator by 2multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2Multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2multiply both by 2multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2multiplymultiplymultiplymultiplymultiply correctlymultiply correctlyfind a least common denominatormultiply correctlymultiplymultiplymultiplicationmultiplymultiplymultiplymultiplymultiplyYesthe denominator is biggershe is incorrect the correct anwser is 1/36she is wrong because you need to find lcd it should be 10/40 + 32/40=1 and 1/20because 32 over 65 is less than half and 32/45 isntI think that Kia could show it. I think this because if she converted all of the denominators to five she could show the answer that way.32/65 is smaller because the denominator is larger. I know this because when the denominator is bigger you will have more parts of the whole. So if you drew this out and put both models side by side you would be able to see that how 32/65 is smaller that 32/45.Robert should double check his. Also qif he changes the denominator you have to do the same thing the numerator.Allison  should remember that if she dose something to the denominator, she has to do the same thing to the numerator.Vennessa needs to remember that whatever she does to the denominator she has to do the same thing to the numerator.Raj needs to remember to not add the fractions and to multiply them.Jamal needs to remember that he has to multiply frations, not add them.Victor needs to remember that whatever he did to the denominator he has to do the same with the numeratorMary needs to remember that she has to multiply fractions not add them.Alexander should remember to multiply thr right numbers.Olivia has to remember that both products have to be the same.Katie needs to remember that she has to find the smallest multiple of both denominators.Ryan needs to remember to find the smallest multiple of both denominartorsMatt needs to remember to make sure that his least common denominator is a multiple of both denominators.Brad had to find a common denominator for both numbersEffie needs to remember to multiply the right numbers .Sally needs to make sure that she multiplies the numbers by the correct numbers.Lester needs to make sure he compares the fractions the right way.Jimmy should remember to multiply the numerators.Kima needs to make sure she finds the least common denominator.Leslie should remember to multiply to get the numerator.D\\'Angelo should compare the fractions using the numerators.Anne should find the right least common denominator.Donna needs to multiply the numerator to get the correct answer.Omar needs to compare the fractions correctly.She could not do it this way. She has to write out 7/9-3/4= but she can not do this problem unless she coverts them first.It is larger because if you have a smaller denominator you have less peices to one whole and that makes the peices bigger.Robert,  You need to multiply both the numerator and denominator by the same number. Then, to check it, divide that fraction by the number you multiplied it by to see if  you get the same answer.Alison, You need to multiply the denominator by the same number as the numerator to get the correct answer.Vanessa, You need to muliply the numerator and denominator by the same number to get the correct answeryou can\\'t add a number to the numerator and the denomantoryou cant add it, you multiplyyou need to havea multiple that goes into both 6 and 10.you need to find a multiple that goes into 21 and 3you need to find the least common denominator of bothyou need to find the LEAST common denominatoryou need to find the LEAST common denominatoryou need to find the LEAST common denominatoryou need to find the LEAST common denominatoryou need to  find the LEAST common denominatoryou need to compare them when the have the same denominatoryou need to not add the numeratoryou need to find the LEAST common denominatoryou need to  not add the numeratoryou need to not chose the larger denominatorI think that Kia is wrong because you have to change the denominators to the same number:I think that Kia is wrong because you have to change the denominators to the same number:I think that Kia is wrong because you have to change the denominators to the same number.32/65 is smaller because you are dividing it into 65ths, not 45thsI think that Kia is wrong because when you subtact and add fractions you never subtract the denominator.15/21 is larger than 15/24 because 15/21 is closer to 1 than 15/24.You need to read the directions more carefully.you tripled the the denominator when you were supposed to double ityou only doubled the denominator not the numeratoryou added three and didn\\'t multiply by twoyou added two and did not multiply by twoyou need to read the directions more carefully.five doesn\\'t go into two so that can not be the answertwenty one times anything will willnot go into threeyou multiplied the denominators by  each otheryou multiplied the denominatorsby each otherthree and one don\\'t go into tworead the directionsread the directionsI think that Kia is wrong because you do not add or subtract a denominator when you are addding and subrtacting fractions.32/65 because 65 is larger and is farther away from 1i think that kia is wrong because she added the denominators and you do not add the denominatorsif you look atb 65 it will have smaller shapes than 45he had to double the numerators and the denominators numbersshe had to double the numinators and the denominators number.she had to double the fraction she hadshe had to double the fraction she hadhe had to double the numerators and the denominators number.he had to double the denoinator and the numerators numberhe had to make the equation go equalshe had to make the equation go equalshe had to make the equation go equalhe had to make the equation go equalkgyuiy7ttftyftfyfdyuugtyyufu y dygfgyf7fyueverything was okayhe had to multiple 4 and 5i think she is wrong because you would need to subtract and get a differenti think she is wrong because you would need to subtract and get a different answer21 is greater because it will have bigger shapes than 24Robert should make sure when he doubles the fractions that he multiplies by two or doubling correctly so that the fractions are equal.He does not have to always multiply the numerater by the denominator on both fractions to try to find the least common denominator.She switched the 7 and the 1 around. So if she did  that ithey would have two different products.She did find a denominator that fits into both fraction but it isn\\'t the least common denominator because it is not the smallest number possible that is the product of both denominators.He did not find the smallest number that is able to be product of both numbers.Since 5/8 is bigger than 5/9 the numerater of 5/8  is bigger than the numerater for 5/9when findingashe shouldn\\'t add the denominator to the equal fractionkia\\'s subtraction is wrong. First she should of made the fractions to like denominators but by not doing it she made the problem a hole step harder and she didn\\'t even get the right answer so, by not making the fractions to like denominators before she did the subtration she messed herself up makind her get the problem wrong.15/21 is larger than 15/24 because they both have the same numerator wile they have differ denominators so by the fraction 15/21 having a smaller denominator but the same numerator as the frcation 15/24 it is larger.I think that she is right because if you count the first two,it equals the last fraction!Its smaller because 32 out of 45 is closer to the whole  than 32 out of 65.try to be carful with your mutiplying,and go with smaller numbers!:)pay attentoin to your mutipying and study more!:)foucus on what your doing and study more!:)next time multiply not add!:)multiply not addnext time multiply ALL your numbers!:)next time multiply!:)try to study more!:)study morestudy more!:)try to study more!!!:)i have trouble on least common denominators to try to study more!!!!!!:)try to study more!!!!!!:)the smaller number is the larger denominator!:)watch your mutiplucation and your number signs!:)watch your icd s !:)watch your number signs!:)the smaller denominators are larger!:)no because you have small pices then big pices and you would need an answer larger than the wholeit is closer to being a wholeyou can see in the pictures that the fifth is smaller than the fourth and the two nineths are smaller  than the fourth too.15  24ths are smaller than 15 21ts because a 24 is a larger number than a 21 so it would take  more peices to build a twenty four peice puzzle than a 21 peice puzzle.  in order to make the puzzle the same size the pieces must be smallerhe did not multiply the numerator or denominator right.you need to find an answer that can be multiplied by both 10 and 6she needs to find the answer  that goes to both problemsyou must find a product that fits both denominatorsthe fractions were uneven the larger denominator is the larger fractionkia is wrong because her two fractions don\\'t convert and if you were to put in the shaded parts of the fraction together they would be too big32 65ths is smaller than the 32 45ths is because the 32 455ths is more than half but 32 65ths is a little less than halfshe is incorrect because she didnt make common denominatersThde denominater is largerYou have to double both numbers by 2Double both numbers by 2Use your brainDouble itDouble itDouble itDouble itDouble itall you have to is multiplyall you have to do is multiplyfind the least common denominatorJust multiplyJust multiplyjust multiplyJust multiplyjust multiplyyou just have to make eual fractionsmake eual fractionsmake equal fractionsfind the lcmfind the lcmfind the lcmfind the lcmfind the lcmidk what you are trying to ask meidkkia is wrong because she added the denominators instead of multiplying the number until she found the smae number in bothbecause there is less space in 45 to fill than there is in 65 to fillrobert you should of did 9 times 2 and 6 times 2 and you would of got an equivalent fractionadison you should of done 5 times 2 and 7 times 2 and you would of got an equivalent fractionvannessa you snould of multipyed both numbers by 2raj you should of multiplyed both numbers by 2jamal you also should of multiplyed both numbers by 2victor youshould have multiplied your numbers by twomary you should of multiplyed by 2alexander you should have multiplied 6x5 and 10x3olivia you shuld have mltiplied 21x1 and 7x3katie you should of multiplied 12x2 and3x8ryan you should of multiplied 5 and 2 and 1 and 10matt yould have multipled 2x6 and 3x4brad you should have multiplied 16x1 and 8x2effie you should have done 9x5 and 15x3sall you should have multiplied 6x4 and 1x24lester you compared incorrectlyjimmy you multiplied wrong for 3 time 4kima you got an incorrect lcdkia is wrong because she did not use the lcd and she subtracted the denominatorsbecause there is less sections to fill in 21 than there is in 24 15/21 is greater than 15/24I think that Kia is not right because in order to subtract these fractions she has to make a common denominator. You need to have the same denominator at all times when you\\'re subtracting or adding. The common denominator that is the smallest in this problem is 36. 9x4=36. 7x4=28. S0, 7/9 is equal to 28/36. 4x9=36. 3x9=27. S0, 3/4 is equal to 27/36. When you subtract 28/36-27/36=1/36. You have to keep the same denominator. You do the same thing with 4/5 and 1/36 to see if they\\'re equal. The common denominator is 180. They are not equal. 1/36 is equal to 5/180. 4/5 is equal to 144/180. That is why Kia is not right.15/21 is larger than 15/24 because 21 is smaller than 24, and when you are talking about fractions 21 has bigger peices than 24. The numerator is the same, but since when you\\'re talking about fractions 21 is larger, 15/21 is larfer than 15/24.Maybe you should write it down on paper instead of doing the problem in your head beacause you might get lost and get the wrong answer, or you might get confused.First, write the problem down on paper so you won\\'t get confused,and then solve the problem.Second, double check your work.Last, make sure your stradegy is correct.Look at your two numerator\\'s and decide which number is larger and then that is the one that is larger. Also, you might want to write the problem down on paper from now on so you don\\'t get confused.I think that Kia needs to have the same denominator to add these two fractions. She could make the denominator 40, and then for 2/8 multiply the 8 by 5 and then the 2 by 5. For 4/5 she could multiply 5 by 8 and then 4 by 8. Since you need the same denominator when you\\'re adding, your end product needs to have the same denominator as well. So, you keep the same denominator, you don\\'t add up all of the denominator\\'s, you keep them the same. So, the product would be 42/40, or 1 2/40.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because since 45 is smaller than 65, when you would draw out the picture, it would have bigger spaces. They have the same numerators, but 45 has bigger spaces, so it will have a bigger value than 32/65.Dear Alex,  next time you do fraction problem make sure your common denominator is in simplest form.Olivia, you should try to make sure you should see if your denominators can be multiplied by 1 and then try that :).Make sure you use  simplest form. :)Make sure you multiply the largest denominator by one.Make sure you make sure you are multiplying in simplest form.:)Nice try but try to make sure you are doing your math the right way.  :]Make sure you multiply the larger fraction by one.    ,\\' (You are not doing the right kind of fractions. You should be multiplying each denominator by each other. :)Make sure do the right kind of comparing D\\'AngeloShe did not do it the right way because, she didn\\'t change the denominators. So the real answer is 4/36.Fifteen twenty firsts are bigger because, there are less left overFifteen twenty firsts are bigger because, there are less left over.1 1/20 because I did 81 1/20 because I did 8 multiplided by 5= 40 2 mltiplided by 5= 10 and 4multiplided by 8= 32 and 32+10= 42Because if the numerator is the same as the other numerator the one with the smaller denominater is bigger.Think about itHigo to dicksTake your timeI have a friend named Matt dudeNice try do your best and keep learningHi Effie I like your name I think you are really smart  and do your bestu were very close try try try try try try try againHI MOMHey broJust keep trying famHye FamDo your best FamDo your best on the testhye broJust keep tryingshe is not right. she added up the denominators when you are supposed to find the least common denominator.because in 32/45 32 is closer to 45 than 65.he needs to read carefully and take his time to get the   problem correct.she needs to work and read carefully.she needs to work carefully.he needs to work more slower.she need to checkNeed to check work.Needs to check workneed to checkneeds to checkhe needs to check his work slowerhe needs to work slower.needs to work slowerneeds to work slowershe need to work slowerNEED TO WORK SLOWERneed to check workshe is wrong. how i know she is wrong is she did not do least common denominator. instead she added the denominators.because 21 is smaller than 24. fifteen could go more easily into 21 than 24.I think that it equals 0/0 because they are equivelent.it\\'s larger because when the denominator is smaller then there are less peices until the whole is complete.Dear Robert, you multiplied by 3 for but, divided 6 by 3 when you needed to multiply by 2.Dear Alison, multiplied 7 by 3 when you should have multiplied 7 by 2 like you did with the 5.dear vannesa, you divided 2 by 2 when you should have multiplied it by 2.Dear Raj, you added 3 when you should have multiplied by 2.Dear Alexander / Alex, you should\\'ve found the number that most of the other numbers could not fit into.dear olivia you should have multiplied 21 by1, and 3 by 7.dear katie you multiplied to high you should havefor the simplest form.dear ryan you multiplied to high and you didn\\'t use the simplest formDear, Matt you should have made them both th same product in simplist formdear brad you should have done 8 by 2 and 16 by 1dear effie, you should have done 1fifteen by three and nine by five to get forty-fivedear sally you should have done 4 by 6 an 24 by 1dear lester, you should have multiplied 9 by 8 and 5 by 8 and 5 by 9hey jim, youshould have multiplied 3 by 4, 5 by 4, 1 by 5, and 4 by 5heykima you should have done 8 as the denominator.hey leslie/sally, you should have multiplied 1 by 3, 4 by 3, 2 by 4, and 3 by 4Dear D\\'Angelo, you shoild have done seven by five, four by five, five by seven, and four by sevenNo because for adding you need to change te denominators.If you cross multiply then 32/45 = 2,080 and 32/65 = 1,440 and 2,080 is greater than 1,440.He needs to wright down the multiples of 10 and 6 and find out wich one is the lowest.she should write down multiples for 21 and 3.she should write down the multiples of 12 and 8.multiply the fractions 72 times 45 and 72 times 40.multiply the numerator with another denominator for bothmultiply the numerator with the oppistite denominator.multiply the numerator with the oppistie denomenatorNo because you need to change the denominators so they are the same.it is so because 21 times 15 is larger than 24 times 15.It is so because 15 times 21 is greater than 15 times 24.Yes she can, her picture shows what she said.It is a smaller differerence.Get help from someoneGet help from someoneuse your brainuse your brainuuse your headuse your headuse your headuse your brainuse your headuse your  headtry your bestuse your headtry your bestawesomeuse your headthinkTHINKthinkthinkthinkthinkthinkthinkthinkYes she did what she said.There is a bigger difference for 32/65I think she is wrong becauseI think she is wrong becauseGet a commen denomanator and multiply the tops by the number you multiplyed for the denomanator.Multiply the denomanator by 1 and 7. then multiply the numerator by what you did to the bottemsYou don\\'t multiply the one denomanator with the other denomanator to get the least common denomanator.appleyou have to multiply the numerator by the number you multipyed the denomanator.you can multiply 1/2 by 8 and then you multiply 7/8 by 2 and then you add themyou see wich fraction is biggeryou see wich fraction is biggeryou add fractionsadd fractionsapplei think she is wrong because she added the denomatorsthe smaller number in the denomators place is always biggershe is wrong because you cant just take 2/8 and 4/5 and add them you have to round them to their least common denominatorbecause 65 is bigger than 45!

I think Kia is correct because the first fraction in the problem, 7/9, the picture has 9 peices and 7 of them are filled in. The next fraction in the problem, 3/4, the picture has 4 peices and 3 of them are filled in. The last fraction in the problem, 4/5, the picture has 5 peices and 4 of them are filled in. So, you can now subtract the numerators,7 and 3 to get a difference of 4, and then you can do the denominators, 9 and 4, and get a difference of 5. So, if you put those 2 numbers into a fraction, the fraction would say 4/5.15/21 is larger than 15/24 because there are less peices to give out or split, and the numerators are the same, so 15/21 is larger than 15/24. You could also think of it as the smaller the denominator, the bigger the fraction.Some advice for you, Alexander, is to find out is what both 10 and 6 can go into in terms of multiplication. 6 times 5 = 30, and 10 times 3=30Olivia, you should see what 21 divided by 7 is. It is 3. So, you can guess that 21 times 1= 21, and 21= 7 times 3Katie, you should prob go into to find the least coomon denominatortoto find the least common denominator you have to find a number that both 6 and 4 go into on terms of mutiplicationBrad,you have to find a number that both 15 and 9 go intoyou have to find a number that both 4 and 24 go intoLester has to see which numerator is the largestYou need to multiply the numerator by how many times you multiplied the demonimator.If the least common demoninator is 8, you have to have the denominator be 8 on both of your fractions. Then, just convert themleslie has to find a lesat common denominator and then find a numerator that fits with the conversionhe has to find the least common denominator and find a numerator that fits with the conversionShe needs to convert the fractions the way she did with the denominators.I think Kim is incorrect because 3/4 is greater than 7/9 because if you convert 3/4 into 27/36 and  7/9 into 21/36, 27/36 is greater than 21/36 therefore you cannot subtract 21/36 from 27/36. Also the answer is greater than 7/9 because if you convert 4/5 into 36/45 it is greater than when you convert 7/9 into 35/45 therefore it is not the true answer unless you are adding 1/45 to 35/45.15/21 is greater than 15/24 because even though their numerators are the same, their deniominators have different areas in each piece and 21 is less  than 24 so the pieces will be bigger therefore 15/21 is greater than 15/24 because it has more area.He could have simplified the fraction to make it eaiser for him to find the numerator and denimonator.Alexander needs to find the least possible multiples of both numbers.Olivia needs to multiple intead of divide when finding the least common deniominator because fractions are related to division.Katie needs to find the least common deniominator instead of finding the product of both numbers.Ryan found the product of both deniominators instead of the least common deniominator.Matt multiplied the numerator times the opppisite deniominator instead of finding the least common deniominator and needed to multipliy each denimonator by another factor to get the same exact multiple.Lester needs to compare  the fractions not the deniominators.JimmyKima needed to multiply the 2 by 4 and the 8 by 1 to give her 4/8 and 7/8.nbhnhI think  Kia is incorrect because if you convert 2/8 into 40ths and 4/5 into 40ths, then add them together they equal more than a whole and her answer is less than a whole.32/65 is less than 32/45 because even though their numerators are the same the deniominators are different.  Because the deniominators are different it makes their values different. 32/65 is divided into more parts than 32/45 so it takes up less area which makes it worth less than 32/45.No, Kia\\'s equation is incorrect because in the equation, Kia added the numorators together like she is supposed to, but she also added the denominators together and you are not supposed to add the denominators together, the denominator always stays the same. Since the denominators are different, you would have to put 2/8 into simplest form which would be 1/4. But the denominators are still different, so you would have to make 1/4 into a fraction with the denominator as 5 which would be 2/5. That is why Kia\\'s answer is incorrect.To make your answer correct, you have to double the numerater, 6 , and double the denominator, 9 , to find 12/18. 9 multiplied by 2 equals 18, which would be the denominator and 6 multiplied by 2 equals 12 would be the numerater.                                                     Correct Answer: 12/18To make the answer correct you have to double the numerator, 5 , and double the denominator, 7. 5 multiplied by 2 equals 10 which would be the numorator and 7 multiplied by 2 equals 14.  Correct Answer: 10/14To have the correct answer you need to multiply the denominator, 6, by 5 which equals 30 and multiply the denominator, 10, by 3 which equals 30.To make the answer correct you need to multiply the denominator, 21 , by one to find 21 and multiply the other denominator, 3 , by 7 to find 21 as the correct answer.To have the correct answer you need to multiply the denominator, 21, by 1 which equals 21 and multiply the denominator, 3, by 7 which equals 21. So, the least common denominator is 21.To have the correct answer you need to multiply the denominator , 12 , by 2 to find 24 and multiply the other denominator , 8, by 3 to find the correct answer of 24.To make the answer correct you need to multiply the denominator, 5, by 2 to find 10 and multiply the other denominator, 10, by 1 to find the correct answer of 10.To make the answer correct you need to multiply the denominator, 6, by 2 to find 12 and multiply the other denominator, 4, by 3 to find the correct answer of 12.To have the correct answer you need to multiply the denominator, 6 , by 2 which equals 12 and then multiply the other denominator, 4 , by 3 which equals 12. So, the least common denominator is 12.To make the answer correct you need to check over the picture of the fractions and see if 5/8 is larger or smaller than 5/9.    Correct Answer: 5/8>5/9To make the answer correct you need to multiply the numerater,3, by 4 and multiply the other numerator,1, by 5 to find the answers of 12/20 and 5/20.Kia\\'s answer is incorrect because 2 1/9 go into 1 1/4 and the final answer would be 13/17.The reason why 15/21 is greater than 15/24 is because 15 is closer to 21 than it is to 24.No because to check, 3/4+4/5 does not equal 7/915/21 is larger than 15/24 because 21sts take up more room than 24thsSome advice for you, Alexander, is to find out is what both 10 and 6 can go into in terms of multiplication. 6 times 5 = 30, and 10 times 3=30Olivia, you should see what 21 divided by 7 is. It is 3. So, you can guess that 21 times 1= 21, and 21= 7 times 3Katie, you should prob go into to find the least coomon denominatortoto find the least common denominator you have to find a number that both 6 and 4 go into on terms of mutiplicationBrad,you have to find a number that both 15 and 9 go intoyou have to find a number that both 4 and 24 go intoLester has to see which numerator is the largestYou need to multiply the numerator by how many times you multiplied the demonimator.If the least common demoninator is 8, you have to have the denominator be 8 on both of your fractions. Then, just convert themleslie has to find a lesat common denominator and then find a numerator that fits with the conversionhe has to find the least common denominator and find a numerator that fits with the conversionShe needs to convert the fractions the way she did with the denominators.No because a number that both 8 and 5 go in to is 40 and using that denominator, the fractions would be 10/40 and 32/40. Those fractions added equal 42/40, and 6/13 is not an equivalent fraction to 42/4032/65 is smaller than 32/45 because 45ths take up more room than 65ths64 1/5.64 1/5.64 4/5. first i did 8 times 13 to get 104 and then i multiplied the numerators by the denomanators to get the new numerators. i did 4/5 plus the numanators added up to get 64 4/532/65 is smaller than 32/45 because 32 plus 32 equals 64 so 32/65 is less than h32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because 32 plus 32 equals 64 so 32/65 is less than half but since for the other one rhe denomanator is 45 32 is more32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because 32 plus 32 equals 64 so 32/65 is less than half but since for the other one the denomanator is 45, 32 is more than half. this evedence proves that 32/65 is smaller than 32/45He needs to either multiply or divide the numerator and denominator .If you doble one of them you half to double the otherHe has to make both equations tp equal the same productEach factor needs to equal the same product.She has to find the least common denominator that the one she had wasn\\'t the least common denominatoreach factor needs to equal the same productyou got it right. Great jobYou got the deenominator right but you forgot to multiply the numerator by the denomanator numberYou did not find the least common denomanator, you had 2 and 8 cant go into 2You have to multiply the numerator by the denomanators numberYou just  got the number sign wrongthe denomanators were not the sameYou have to convert the fractions by the numerator that was addedIt does not because when you find the least common denomanator (36) and subtract the numerators it equals 1/36Since the numerators are the same and the nomanators are different the one with the smaller denomanator is largerThis equasion is wrong because you have to give the fractions like denominators before you subtract anything15/21 is larger than 15/24 because if you drew a picture, you would see that 15/21 leaves less space than 15/24, making it larger.You have to keep the change the same. do to the numerator what you do to the denominator.Study your multiplcation facts.Then you will get the proplems correct  when doing fractions .Also what you do to the numerator you must do yo the denomator.You should read the directions more carefully so you multiply/divide right. Remember your math facts. What you do to the denomator yoy must do to the numerator.You should study your multiplication facts so your fractions will be right. Read the problem closer.She needs to read the problem closely and pay attention to what you are doing . Also learn your math facts.Do not divide but  but multiply to get the comman denomator.Pay more attention to what you\\'re doing. Also, don\\'t mix things up.You should try all the numbers before choosing your pick.Do not multiply the denomators.Pay more attention! Practice your math facts! Don\\'t be lazy!Do not multiply and divide on the same problem !And read the problem closely.Becareful when reading and study your facts for math.Read closelyYou should be more careful when multiplying numbers to make an equal fraction. You should probably also use quadrilaterals to compare.Study your mutiplycation facts read closely and compare better.sup computerRead the problem more carefully so you get all your mistakes right.Pay attention and LEARN YOUR MULTIPLICATION FACTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Also becareful when you are using fractions.Make sure you multiply correctly so you get the right answer.Kia added the denominatirs, which never should be done when adding fractions.The larger denominator makes that fraction smaller.65 is bigger than 45, which makes it smaller. Also, 32 out of 45 is more than 32 out of 65.she is right because 8+5=13 and 2+4=6he needs to do 9x2=18 and then do 6x2=12 an dthats how you get          12/18she had a 21 instaid of a 14he need to do 6x5=30=3x10 because 6x5=30 and 3x10=30she needs to do 21x1=1 and 7x3=21Kaitie needs to do 12x2=24 and 3x8=24Ryan needs to do 5x2=10=1x10Matt needs to do 6x2=12=3x4Brad need to do 8x2=16=1x16Effie needs to do 15x3=45=5x9 because 5x9=45 and 15x3=45Sally needs to do 4x6=24=1x24 because 4x6=24 and 1x24=24Lester needs to do 5x8 and 9x8 that\\'s for the first one and for the 2nd one he needs to do 5x9 and 8x9to fix the problem Jimmy has to do 3x4=12 and 5x4=20 and for the 2nd one Jimmy has to do 1x5=5 and 4x5=20Kima has to do 1x7=7 and1x8=8 that\\'s for the first one and for the 2nd one you have to do do 1x4=4 and 2x4=8she has to do 1x3=3 and 4x3=12 thats for the 1st one for the 2nd one you have to do 2x4=8 and 3x4=12He needs to do 4x5=20 and 7x5=35 thats for the first one and for the 2nd one you have to do 4x7=28 and 5x7=35i think she is wrong because she is -

If only 1 number goes in and not the other than the number you had before is the smallest.Olivia, you need to check your work and make sure it makes since the denominator should be a multiple of one of the denominators.Katie, you got a common denominaor but it wasn\\'t the least common denominator. Before answering a problem make sure that the denominaor you have is the lowest or else you\\'ll get the problem wrong.The bigger number isn\\'t the bigger fraction.Dont add the numeratorfind the least common denominator not just a common denominatorDo not add the numeratorThe larger denominator is not always the larger fractionUse the same least common denominatorDON\\'T ADD THE NUMERATORthe larger denominator does not always make it the larger fractionKia just added the denominators together and the the numerators together to get 6/13 instead of finding the least commo denominator and adding hem the correct way.32/65 in smaller than 32/45 because 65 is bigger than 45 so he number 32 would take up less space. 65-32 would equal 33 and 45-32 would be13 so  33 is bigger than 13 and ha means 32/65 is smaller than 32/45.no, because the dinominators half to be the same to add the fractions.32 65fifths is bigger than 32 45fithsbretand ethanremember to check over your workremember to always check your work Kaitieryan always remeber to check your work before you submit the questionhialways check your work to make sure its right.always remember to cheack your workremember to ckeack your workalways remember to check your work before you submit the answermutiplyremember to  mul   tiplyremember to check your workshe is wrong24 is bigger than 21the first one is 2/6th second one 4/5th 3rd one 6/13thi dont think it is smaller than 32/65I think that she is wrong.She is wrong because if you add the two fractions the answer would be above one whole.32/65 is smaller than 32/45 because 65 is bigger than 45 and in fractions the bigger the denomanater is the smaller the peices get and since 65 is larger than 45 and 32 is the same as 32 65/32 is smaller than 45/32.What you need to do next time to get the problem correct is not divide six by three but multiply six by two.To get the problem correct you need to multiply the five in the numerator and the six in the denomonator to get thirty. and three trims ten is equal to six by fiveWhat Oliva needs to bo to get the correct answer is get the least common denominator for both fractions.To get the correct answer to this problem is  to find the closest least common denominatorTo get the problem correct Ryan needs to closest least common denominator.I think that she is wrong because you have to make both of the fractions equivalent to each other before you subtract them.15/21 is larger than 15/24 beause the larger the demoninator the smaller the pieces and 21 isn smaller than 24 so that is why 15/21 is larger than 15/24.I think that if you add them then you will fing the answerI think that if you add them then you will fing the answerI think that if you add them then you will find the answerI think that if you add them then you will find the answer32/65 is mot smaller than 32/45 because 65 is bigger then 45 so then it is not smaller but they need to have a common bottom number they don\\'t so they need to32/65 is mot smaller than 32/45 because 65 is bigger then 45 so then it is not smaller but they need to have a common bottom number they don\\'t so they need to youyou need to cross multiple to get the answer or just times 5 =30 and so does 10 times 3mulitply by 8 in both and get your answer5 times what equles 20 then mulitaply 3 time = 12 so 12 over 20 is the answer.just multply them together and it is the answerThe answer is not right because you can\\'t subtract different denominters so the answer is not 4/5 you need to find some multiples to answer the problem so find the multiples. and here are some like 40,40 20,2015/24 is bigger then 15/21 because 21 is smaller then 24 so that is why 15/24 is bigger then 15/21.21 is smaller then 24.I think it is 2/8+4/5+ 6/13=the denominatorFirst write out all the product that 6 makes.

Then multiply the number that you used to get your least common denominator.He needs to make sure thAT HE IS MULTIPLYING the same number for numorator and denominatorYou have to make common denominatersYou have to make common denominatersWhen you make common denominatersmultiply the least common danominators to get the writ answermultiply the largest number both danominatorsfind the least common denomitormultiply the numerator by whatever you multiply the denominator byfind out f the dnjis wrong becauseis  thtink she is wrong because thethink she is wrong because she didnt  correctly do the problemthink she is wrong because she didnt  correctly do the problemthink she is wrong because she didnt  correctly do the problemthink she is wrong because she didnt  correctly do the problemI  think she is wrong because she didnt  correctly do the problem she has to find the lcd firstthe denominator is less than he other denominator so the 15 that has 21 has a denominator is closerI think that Kia is incoretRobert needs to read carefully and needs toHe needs to read the problem carefuly and find outshe needs to read the problem carefully and find lcdkatie needs to red he problem carefully and find lcdryan needs t read the problem carefully and find lcdhe needs to read the directions more carefully and find lcdhe needs to read the problem carefully and find lcdshe needs toread the problem carefully and find lcdHe needs to read  the problem carefully and find lcdHe needs to read the problem carefully and find lcdShe needs to read the problem carefully and find lcdShe needs to read the problem carefully and find lcdhe needs to read more carefully and kcdnow li think she needs to read the problem carefully andi think she needs to read the problem carefully and fi think she needs to read the problem carefully and findI think she needs to read the problem carefully and find lcd.Bcause the 15in 15/21 is closer to the denominatorBcause the 15in 15/21 is closer to the denominatorBcause the 15in 15/21 is closer to the denominator andBcause the 15in 15/21 is closer to the denominator and   the 15 in 15/24 is further away from the denminator.She needs a common denominator  to subtract, she just subtracted with the numbers shown. If she subtracted she might of got the right answer.15/21 is bigger than 15/24 because 24 - 15 = 9 , and 21 - 15 = 6. that tells that you would only have to add 6 to the numorator of  15/21, and you would have to add 9 to 15/24 numorator.think of the different multiples.if you  Know what 7 x 3 =21 than you kmow that in that problem that is the denominatorpractice multiplacation5x2=106x4=24,but 6x2=12  and 4x3=128 x 2 = 169x5=45 and 15x3=45practice multiplyingNo you multiplycation math factsKnow that 5x4=20count the lines and spaces on the number line3x4=125x7=35count the amount of spaces on the number line6x2=12 and 4x3=12know the multiplacation factsYou have to find a common denominator to get the right answer32+33=65 and 32+13=452 8 4 5 =6 13because 65 is bigger than 45vvvvv6*5=30=3*10                                                                                         Then  you  have the smallest  number that goes into both denominators . So that was Alexander\\'s mistakes.40/72 is equal to 5/9 72is the denomantor12/20=3/5 > 5/20=1/4 20 was the denomator for each fraction.7/8 is equal to 7/8 than1/2 is equal to 4/8 than the denomantorI THINK KIA IS RIGHTBECAUSE 15/21 IS colser than 15/24She did show the correct fractions from her equation.It is not smaller because no matter what,65 is bigger than 45    :/You have to multiply by 2multiply by 2 got datmultiply by 2multiply by numba 2times 2x2x2x2go to 30shes not smartshe did not use the least common denominatorhe did not use the least common denominatorhe didnt use the least common denominatorjung ho brad didnt use the least common denominatorshe did not use da least common denominatorshe didnt use the least common denominatorshe compared the fractions wrongshe addedthe icd is the largest factor for both denominatorsshe added bruhTHIS DANGELO KID DID IT COMPLETELY WRONGAnne did it complety wrongyou need to multiply not add girlhe said the larger debnominator is the largest fractiobnshe is rightit isntI do not agree with her because if you add up all the numerators you would get 12. And if you add up the denominators you would get 14. So if you put them together you would get 12I do not agree with her because if you add up all the numerators you would get 12. And if you add up the denominators you would get 14. So if you put them together you would get 12/1432/65 is smaller than 32/45 because if you put them in fractions you would actually see that 32/45 has more pieces left in the fraction than 32/65 does.Robert could multiply 9 times 2 and 6 times 2 because he did 9 times 3 and 6 divided by 3 and that was not correctshe needs to do the problem by doubling not tripling the denominator to get 10/14 not 10/21The tip I would give Vanessa could be to multiply 2 times 2 and 8 times 2. But if she gets it correct it would be 4/16 not 1/16He swiched the two numbers 5 and 3 and made the product 1 not 30.  He should get 6 times 5 and 3 times 10 witch should get 30 for both.she mixed ud up the numbers because they would not get the same least common denominatorshe had the largestcommon denominator that goes into both denominatorsshe hadhe did the smallest number that goes into bothBrad, you did pretty good. You just need to look at at the problem carefullyHe needs to look at the problem again and thinke about it.he needs to read the promblem again and look at it some more toget the right answerhe needs to look at iaction more carefullyt closerI think she shold draw a different  and better picture of her fractions to her and us make it more clearer to understandBecause if you make it a fraction you would see that 15/21 is larger than 15/24 because 15/21 has more unshaded fractions than 15/24NO. I think no because there is a whole number. 7/9 isNO. I think no because there is a whole number. 7/9 isNO. I think no because there is a whole number. 7/9 is equal to 28/36. 3/4 is equal to 27/36. 27/36+28/36=55/36 or 1 19/36.He needs to do the same operation for both the denomenater and numerater. Also, the same number in the same operation.She needs to do the same opperation and the same number in the opperation.The lowest number that is a product of both denominaters.She needs to do the smaller number into both.She needs to do two different numbers in the problem.she needs to find the smallest number for both.She needs to find a product thatboth denomaters go into.He needs to look at the opperation symbel.She needs to find the largest number that goes into both denomanatersSmallest number that goes into both denomanaters.It doesnt mater if the denominater is bigger.You have to multiply the same number for bothDon\\'t always multiply it by 2.She needs to mulyiply them by the same nujmberHe needs to look at the numerater.I think it looks correct.The denominater of the first one,65, is bigger but is less peices. Both of their numinaters are the same. So the largest one is the smallest denominater.if 2 plus 4 equals 6 it is right.never add subtract multiple or divide the denomanater.32 is closer to 45 then 32 is to 65he did not multiply the numerator or denominator right.you need to find an answer that can be multiplied by both 10 and 6she needs to find the answer  that goes to both problemsyou must find a product that fits both denominatorsthe fractions were uneven the larger denominator is the larger fractionshe got it right 7 - 3 = 415 is closer to 21 then 15 is to 24Robert needs to read carefully and needs toHe needs to read the problem carefuly and find outshe needs to read the problem carefully and find lcdkatie needs to red he problem carefully and find lcdryan needs t read the problem carefully and find lcdhe needs to read the directions more carefully and find lcdhe needs to read the problem carefully and find lcdshe needs toread the problem carefully and find lcdHe needs to read  the problem carefully and find lcdHe needs to read the problem carefully and find lcdShe needs to read the problem carefully and find lcdShe needs to read the problem carefully and find lcdhe needs to read more carefully and kcdnow lI\\'d think it would be 1/36. Because I got 36 as a denominator  and subtracted 27/36 from 28/36.the reason it is larger is because think if you had two boxes and one 15/21 and the other one had 15/24 there is more empty space in the second oneI think Kia might have have used a different operation because when I did it i got a different answer15/21 is bigger because it has a smaller deomonaterMake sure to multipliy the denominator and the numeraternext time dont always change to denomanatornext time find other numbers instead of just multiplyingNEXT TIME TRY TO FIND THE LOWEST NUMBERNEXT TIME FIND LEAST COMMON DENOMANATORNEXT TIME TRY TO CHANGE ONLY ONE NUMBERNEXT TIME FIND A NUMBER THAT THEY CAN GO INTONEXT TIME FIND A NUMBER THAT THEY CAN GO INTOONLY CHANGE ONE NUMBERThe bigger number isn\\'t the bigger fraction.Dont add the numeratorfind the least common denominator not just a common denominatorDo not add the numeratorThe larger denominator is not always the larger fractionUse the same least common denominatorDON\\'T ADD THE NUMERATORthe larger denominator does not always make it the larger fractionIt cant be 6/13 becuase of the picture shown. She must have subtracted32/65 is smaller becuase it has a larger denominator'"

then must convert numerators fraction denominator 40 , also . to , must multiply numerator number multipllied denominator get common denominator . since used expression 8 x 5 , 2 must multiplied 5 . 2 x 5 = 10 , new fraction 10/40 . then must convert 4/5 fraction 40 denominator . since multiplied 5 8 , must 4 . 4 x 8 = 32 , new fraction equivalent 4/5 32/40 . then add together- change denominators

, use fraction made would common denominator would easier figue one bigger.our advice jimmy whatever number multiply get denominator , numerator . if would done numerator , could gotten right answer.i think kia n't added denominators denominators represent whole added numerators . kia also convert denominators make common denominator make easier add.32/65 smaller 32/45 32/45 spaces would shaded 45
